# 🎯 Deterministic Liquidation for Locked Bitcoin

*dVaults* are Taproot-based Bitcoin vaults that enforce deterministic liquidation and non-custodial collateral management. Each vault encodes three spend paths:
1. **Repay** - borrower + DCN authorization.  
2. **Liquidate** - DCN-only authorization when collateral falls below the minimum ratio.  
3. **Delinquency** - DCN-only authorization when credit line is not paid off or extended at end of term.  
4. **Transfer** - borrower + DCN + third party authorization when borrower requests loan transfer out of Surge Credit Market.  
5. **Escape** - borrower-only fallback after a time-based lock (censorship safety).

Each path references a **pre-committed PSBT template** defined at vault creation.

## Delinquency Flow
Just before the time based lock is hit, the ESM checks if the credit line is fully paid off:
1. The ESM emits a `DelinquencyTriggered` event. 
2. The coordination middleware publishes the corresponding liquidation instruction.
3. DCN members reconstruct the PSBT based on committed vault parameters.
4. The DCN signs and broadcasts the transaction to Bitcoin.
5. Liquidated BTC is routed to the **DCN** while a dutch auction is started on the EVM layer. 
6. The dutch auction returns stablecoins which replace the principal + debt of the line of credit being liquidated.
7. Remaining BTC is **re-locked** into a new dVault UTXO under the same script conditions with an incremented nonce.

## Key Guarantees
- **Non-Custodial:** BTC remains locked in Taproot vaults on Bitcoin, only user + DCN or timelock can move funds.  
- **Deterministic:** All state transitions and PSBTs are reproducible and verifiable across signers.  
- **Censorship-Safe:** Borrowers can always reclaim funds through the Escape path after timelock expiry.  
- **Market Segregated Risk:** Delinquency proceeds flow into the each market based on where the delinquent credit line came from, reconciling BTC collateral and stablecoin liabilities within the Execution State Machine’s deterministic ledger.
