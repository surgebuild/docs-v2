# 🔐 dVaults: Programmable Bitcoin Vaults

A **dVault** is a Bitcoin Taproot UTXO (BIP341) whose spend conditions are committed via **MAST/Tapscript** (BIP342).  
dVaults are the **collateral engine** of Surge and BTC never leaves Bitcoin; spends are only possible under pre-committed conditions.

## Core Scripting

- Each vault commits a **taptree** of spend leaves (miniscript/tapscript). Only the executed leaf is revealed on spend; unused branches remain hidden.
- The **key path** (MuSig2 aggregate of user + signer epoch) handles the common “repayment” flow cheaply.
- **Script leaves** handle exceptional paths (liquidation, signer rotation, timelock) with timelocks.

## Spend Paths

- **Repayment** — BTC can be spent via the **key path** by `MuSig2(P_user, P_epoch)` after the execution environment attests that debt was repaid.  

_Enforced by signers + state proofs; the script enforces signatures only._
- **Liquidation** — If CR < MinCR, signers spend via a **CSV-gated** script leaf. The spend creates outputs:
   - Discounted sale to Stability Pool
   - Change re-locked to a fresh dVault

_CR check is off-chain; the script enforces signer control + delay._
- **Signer rotation** — After a cooldown, funds are re-locked to the **next signer epoch** (key rotation).
- **Timelock** — After a long **CLTV**, the depositor can unilaterally recover with a dedicated recovery key.

## Script Structures

Below are simplified representations of how dVaults enforce these conditions on Bitcoin.

### 1. Repayment Path (Ledger-Validated Unlock)

```bitcoin-script
# Requires depositor + MPC signers (cb-mpc)
# Only valid if repayment event is confirmed in execution environment
AND(
    OP_CHECKSIG(user_pubkey),
    OP_CHECKSIG(mpc_aggkey_epoch)
)
```

### 2. Liquidation Path (Micro-Liquidations)

```bitcoin-script
# Signers + Stability Pool key can spend part of BTC if CR < MinCR
AND(
    OP_CHECKSIG(mpc_aggkey_epoch),
    OP_CHECKSIG(stability_pool_key)
)
```

## Lifecycle

1. **Deposit** — User locks BTC to the Taproot address (key path = `MuSig2(P_user, P_epoch)`).
2. **Borrow** — Execution environment issues stablecoins against the attested deposit.
3. **Monitoring** — BTC/USD oracle updates CR, state commits record epochs, debts, and Stability Pool balances.
4. **Incremental Liquidations** — If `CR < MinCR`, signers spend via the liquidation leaf. The spend MUST produce:
   - **SP purchase** — discounted BTC to the Stability Pool, and
   - **Relock** — change re-locked to a new dVault taptree for the user.
5. **Repayment/Close** — Upon debt repayment, signers co-sign the key-path spend, moving BTC per user instructions (often to a new user-controlled output).

## Security Anchors

- **On-chain invariants (script):** Schnorr key ownership, `CSV/CLTV` timelocks, branch commitment in MAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree).
- **Off-chain invariants (signers/state):** CR evaluation, repayment attestation, SP discount schedule, and epoch rotation rules tied to the execution environment’s state root.
- **Signer tech:** <a href="https://github.com/coinbase/cb-mpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="opacity-80 hover:opacity-100 hover:underline cursor-pointer transition-colors">Coinbase's cb-mpc</a> with **MuSig2** (Schnorr) for Taproot keys; threshold **ECDSA** only where interop requires it (non-Bitcoin contexts).
