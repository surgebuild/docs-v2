# 🔐 dVaults: Programmable Bitcoin Vaults

A **dVault** is a Bitcoin Taproot UTXO locked under a set of **conditions**.  
They are the foundation of Surge’s collateral system, combining Bitcoin Scripts with signer validation.
## Core Scripting
Each vault commits to a **MAST (Merkleized Abstract Syntax Tree)** of spend paths:
- **Repayment path** → BTC can be released when debt is repaid.  
- **Liquidation path** → BTC slice can be transferred to Stability Pool if collateral ratio drops.  
- **Migration path** → BTC can be re-locked under a new signer set with cooldown.  
- **Escape hatch** → Depositor can reclaim funds unilaterally after a timelock.  

Unused branches remain hidden, preserving privacy and efficiency.

## Lifecycle
1. **Deposit**: User locks BTC into Taproot address with dVault script tree.  
2. **Borrow**: Execution environment issues stablecoins (e.g., USDC) against collateral.  
3. **Maintenance**: Oracles update BTC/USD price; vault health monitored continuously.  
4. **Micro-Liquidations**: If collateral ratio falls, small BTC slices are sold to Stability Pool to rebalance, not wipe out the whole position.  
5. **Repayment/Closure**: Debt repaid → BTC unlocked through repayment branch.  

## Security
- **Bitcoin Scripts** enforce timelocks and conditional spends.  
- **MPC Signers (cb-mpc)** ensure BTC cannot move without ledger validation.  
- **Escape hatch** guarantees depositor sovereignty.  

dVaults turn BTC into programmable, sovereign, and auditable collateral.
