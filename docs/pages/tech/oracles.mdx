# 🔮 Oracle System
The **Oracle System** is Surge’s native BTC/USD price feed mechanism. Unlike external oracle plug-ins, Surge treats price discovery as a **core module of the state machine**, ensuring collateralization logic is deterministic, and consensus-driven.

The Oracle System powers:
- **Collateral Monitoring** - updating each dVault’s live Collateral Ratio (CR).
- **Liquidation Enforcement** - triggering liquidation conditions when CR < MinCR.
- **System Integrity** - anchoring liabilities to verifiable BTC/USD market prices without relying on off-chain actors.

By embedding price feeds directly into consensus, Surge eliminates discretionary trust and guarantees **programmatic, protocol-native valuation of Bitcoin collateral**.

## Importance
1. **Protocol-Native**  
   - Oracle updates are finalized inside the Execution Layer itself.  
   - Validators replicate the same aggregation logic, guaranteeing a single source of truth.

2. **Deterministic Medianization**  
   - Multiple signed submissions per block.  
   - Aggregated into a medianized price point, finalized with the block.  
   - Ensures liveness and robustness against outliers or malicious feeds.

3. **Consensus Enforcement**  
   - Prices only become valid once included in a finalized block.  
   - Prevents validator divergence and eliminates latency arbitrage.

## Failure Safety
- **Deterministic Fallbacks**  
  If insufficient updates are available, the system reuses the last confirmed state until new data finalizes.

- **Graceful Degradation**  
  Execution halts collateral ratio updates temporarily, but state remains coherent and auditable.

- **Manipulation Resistance**  
  Medianization + consensus replication prevent single-source manipulation.  
  Validators rejecting invalid submissions ensures Byzantine resilience.

## Oracle Events
The Oracle System emits canonical events:
- `PriceUpdated { medianPrice, timestamp }`
- `CollateralRatioUpdated { vaultId, newCR }`
- `LiquidationTriggered { vaultId, CR }`

These events bind signer permissions and provide a complete audit trail for liquidation logic.
