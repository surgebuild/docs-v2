# 📡 Cross-Chain Settlement & Liquidity

### Stablecoin Routing with CCTP v2
Surge integrates **Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP v2)** as the backbone for stablecoin routing. This system enables **burn-and-mint semantics** for USDC across supported chains, guaranteeing:
- **Canonical USDC Supply**: No wrapped or synthetic USDC is introduced.
- **Deterministic Routing**: User requests stablecoin on Chain A, burns it, and receives a mint on Chain B.
- **Settlement Finality**: Transfers are secured by Circle’s attestation network.


This ensures liquidity is always **fungible and settlement-grade**, a critical requirement for institutions.


### Canonical Stability Pool
The **Stability Pool** acts as the single liquidation clearinghouse for Surge. Even though user-facing transactions can occur on any connected chain, **all liquidation settlements resolve in the canonical Stability Pool**.


- **Design**: Implemented as a stateful contract on a chosen execution chain (e.g., Ethereum).
- **Inputs**: Stablecoins deposited by liquidity providers.
- **Outputs**: Discounted BTC distributed upon liquidation events.
- **Arbitrage Safety**: Prevents fragmented pricing by consolidating bad debt resolution.


| Component | Function |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CCTP v2 | Moves stablecoin liquidity across chains |
| Stability Pool | Canonical clearinghouse for liquidation settlements |
| Liquidation Trigger | Initiated on any chain, validated against BTC state + CR threshold |
| BTC Distribution | Discounted BTC flows to Stability Pool providers |


### Liquidation Lifecycle
1. dVault collateral ratio drops below minimum.
2. Execution layer emits a `LiquidationTriggered` event.
3. Stablecoins from the canonical Stability Pool absorb the bad debt.
4. BTC collateral released to Stability Pool depositors at a discount.


This process ensures **predictable liquidation markets** without predatory MEV-driven liquidators.
