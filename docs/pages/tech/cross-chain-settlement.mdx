# 📡 Liquidity Management & Stability Pools

## Stablecoin Routing
Routes stablecoins (e.g., USDC, USDT) across major networks (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, etc.) while maintaining a canonical supply:

- **Canonical Supply** - no wrapped or synthetic representations.
- **Adapter-Based Routing** - integrates with pluggable adapters (e.g., CCTPv2 etc.,) to enable issuer verified cross-chain transfers.
- **Deterministic Settlement** - tokens are burned on the source chain and minted on the destination upon verified authorization.
- **Settlement Finality** - mints require signed attestations from the issuer verifiable on-chain.

This design ensures liquidity is **fungible, auditable, and settlement-grade** - essential for institutional adoption.

## Canonical Stability Pool
The **Stability Pool** is Surge’s liquidation clearinghouse. While stablecoin activity spans multiple chains, all liquidation flows resolve in the **single canonical pool**.

- **Implementation** - a stateful contract deployed on a chosen execution chain (e.g., Ethereum).
- **Inputs** - stablecoins deposited by liquidity providers.
- **Outputs** - discounted BTC distributed to pool participants during liquidations.
- **Market Integrity** - Centralizes bad debt absorption, preventing fragmented liquidations or MEV-driven arbitrage.

| Component | Function |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stability Pool** | Canonical clearinghouse for liquidation settlements |
| **Liquidation Trigger** | Initiated on any chain, validated against BTC state + CR threshold |
| **BTC Distribution** | Discounted BTC flows to Stability Pool depositors |

{/* ## Micro Liquidation Lifecycle
When a dVault’s collateral ratio (CR) falls below the minimum threshold:
1. CR Validation → Medianized BTC/USD prices from trusted oracles confirm the breach.
2. Trigger → The Execution State emits a LiquidationTriggered event.
3. Debt Absorption → The Stability Pool automatically covers the undercollateralized debt using pooled stablecoins.
4. Collateral Distribution → The Deterministic Liquidation program executes pre-committed **PSBTs**, sending the corresponding BTC tranche to the Stability Pool at a protocol defined discount.  
5. **Re-Lock** — Remaining BTC is re-locked into a new dVault under the same script policy with an incremented nonce.

This deterministic process ensures **continuous, predictable liquidation markets** through **micro-liquidations**, without opportunistic fragmented liquidator auctions.*/}
