# 📡 Cross-Chain Settlement & Liquidity

## Stablecoin Routing via CCTP v2
Surge integrates **Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol [(CCTP v2)](https://www.circle.com/cross-chain-transfer-protocol)** for stablecoin settlement. CCTP uses **burn and mint semantics** to move USDC across chains:

- **Canonical Supply** - no wrapped or synthetic USDC is ever created.
- **Deterministic Routing** - stablecoins are burned on the source chain and minted on the destination.
- **Settlement Finality** - transfers secured by Circle’s attestation network.

This design ensures liquidity is **fungible, auditable, and settlement-grade** - essential for institutional adoption.

## Canonical Stability Pool
The **Stability Pool** is Surge’s liquidation clearinghouse. While stablecoin activity spans multiple chains, all liquidation flows resolve in the **single canonical pool**.

- **Implementation** - a stateful contract deployed on a chosen execution chain (e.g., Ethereum).
- **Inputs** - stablecoins deposited by liquidity providers.
- **Outputs** - discounted BTC distributed to pool participants during liquidations.
- **Market Integrity** - consolidates bad debt resolution into one venue, preventing fragmented pricing or MEV-driven arbitrage.

| Component | Function |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CCTP v2** | Moves stablecoin liquidity across supported chains |
| **Stability Pool** | Canonical clearinghouse for liquidation settlements |
| **Liquidation Trigger** | Initiated on any chain, validated against BTC state + CR threshold |
| **BTC Distribution** | Discounted BTC flows to Stability Pool depositors |

## Micro Liquidation Lifecycle
When a dVault’s collateral ratio (CR) falls below the minimum threshold:
1. CR Validation → Medianized BTC/USD prices from trusted oracles confirm the breach.
2. Trigger → The Execution Layer emits a LiquidationTriggered event.
3. Debt Absorption → The Stability Pool automatically covers the undercollateralized debt using pooled stablecoins.
4. Collateral Distribution → A proportional slice of BTC collateral is released at a discount to Stability Pool providers.

This deterministic process ensures **continuous, predictable liquidation markets** through **micro-liquidations**, without opportunistic fragmented liquidator auctions.
