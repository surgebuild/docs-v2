# 📡 Cross-Chain Settlement & Liquidity

## Stablecoin Routing via Native Burn–Mint Bridge
Surge routes fiat-backed stablecoins using an issuer-authorized burn-and-mint protocol across chains:

- **Canonical Supply** - no wrapped or synthetic representations.
- **Deterministic Routing** - tokens are burned on the source chain and minted on the destination upon verified authorization.
- **Settlement Finality** - mints require signed attestations from the issuer (or an approved attestation service) recorded on-chain.

This design ensures liquidity is **fungible, auditable, and settlement-grade** - essential for institutional adoption.

## Canonical Stability Pool
The **Stability Pool** is Surge’s liquidation clearinghouse. While stablecoin activity spans multiple chains, all liquidation flows resolve in the **single canonical pool**.

- **Implementation** - a stateful contract deployed on a chosen execution chain (e.g., Ethereum).
- **Inputs** - stablecoins deposited by liquidity providers.
- **Outputs** - discounted BTC distributed to pool participants during liquidations.
- **Market Integrity** - consolidates bad debt resolution into one venue, preventing fragmented pricing or MEV-driven arbitrage.

| Component | Function |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stability Pool** | Canonical clearinghouse for liquidation settlements |
| **Liquidation Trigger** | Initiated on any chain, validated against BTC state + CR threshold |
| **BTC Distribution** | Discounted BTC flows to Stability Pool depositors |

## Micro Liquidation Lifecycle
When a dVault’s collateral ratio (CR) falls below the minimum threshold:
1. CR Validation → Medianized BTC/USD prices from trusted oracles confirm the breach.
2. Trigger → The Execution State emits a LiquidationTriggered event.
3. Debt Absorption → The Stability Pool automatically covers the undercollateralized debt using pooled stablecoins.
4. Collateral Distribution → A proportional slice of BTC collateral is released at a discount to Stability Pool providers.

This deterministic process ensures **continuous, predictable liquidation markets** through **micro-liquidations**, without opportunistic fragmented liquidator auctions.
