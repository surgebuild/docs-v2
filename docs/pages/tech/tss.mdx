# 👥 Threshold Schnorr Signatures (TSS)

Surge leverages **Threshold Schnorr Signatures (TSS)** for securing Bitcoin Taproot vaults (dVaults). TSS ensures that vault funds cannot be moved without quorum agreement among a distributed set of signers, preventing unilateral control or custody risk.

## Why Schnorr TSS Matters for dVaults

- **Taproot Compatibility** - Bitcoin’s Taproot (BIP340) mandates Schnorr signatures. TSS outputs must be indistinguishable from single-party Schnorr signatures to maintain privacy and efficiency.
- **Non-Custodial Guarantee** - No individual signer can move BTC; only a threshold of signers can jointly authorize a transaction.
- **Byzantine-Resilient security** - Vaults must remain operable even if some signers are malicious or offline. Abort conditions must be avoided to prevent capital lock-up.

## Lin22 vs. FROST

Two leading Schnorr TSS protocols were evaluated:

- **FROST (RFC 9591)** - Optimized for speed (2 signing rounds).
- **Lindell 2022 (Lin22)** - Optimized for robustness, with 3 signing rounds and full security proofs.

#### Comparison Table

| Property | **FROST** | **Lin22 (2022)** |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Signing Rounds** | 2 | 3 |
| **Security Proof** | **UC secure** (Universally Composable), but aborts if signers fail | **Full simulatability** with Fischlin ZKPs |
| **Abort Handling** | Protocol halts if any signer malicious, need to trust coordinator | Identifies cheaters with proof; removes signer for next set of request |
| **DKG Setup** | ~2 rounds (Pedersen VSS) | 5+ rounds (Feldman VSS, more secure) |
| **Best Case** | Highly efficient when all honest | Robust to faults |
| **Output** | BIP340 Schnorr | BIP340 Schnorr |

## Why Surge Chooses Lin22

Surge prioritizes **liveness and accountability** over lowest latency:

- **Abort = Dead Capital** - With FROST, one unresponsive or malicious signer can permanently lock a vault. Lin22 avoids this by enabling recovery.
- **Identifiable Misbehavior** - Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) provide cryptographic evidence of cheating, enabling automated slashing and signature share rotation.
- **Privacy Preserving** - Outputs remain indistinguishable from native Schnorr signatures, ensuring Taproot spends look standard.

## Lin22 Signing Flow in Surge

#### 1. Distributed Key Generation (DKG)
- Key shares are generated using **Feldman’s VSS**.
- Public commitments allow verification that shares are consistent.
- Result: A single Taproot public key with private shares held by signers.

#### 2. Signing Rounds

**Round 1 - Commitment**  
- Each signer selects a fresh random nonce and broadcasts a *hash commitment* to it.  
- Inclusion in this round is mandatory.

**Round 2 - Decommitment & Proof**  
- Signers reveal their nonces and provide **Fischlin Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**.  
- Invalid or missing proofs immediately flag the signer as malicious.

**Round 3 - Signature Shares**  
- Honest signers compute signature shares using their secret key share and nonce.  
- Coordinator verifies ZKPs and aggregates valid shares.  
- Final output: A single **BIP340 Schnorr signature**, valid for Taproot.

## Example: 3 of 4 Signing

- **FROST** → If a signer submits invalid data (e.g., a bad signature share), the entire signing protocol aborts. The honest participants cannot complete the signature. Need to trust coordinator to remove malicious signer.
- **Lin22** → If a signer misbehaves, their ZK proof (included in the protocol) reveals them as malicious to the network. The session aborts, but with publicly verifiable evidence of who misbehaved. this will help for slashing and signature share rotation.

**dVault remains operable even under Byzantine conditions.**

Surge adopts Lin22 for Schnorr TSS because resilience matters more than speed when securing Bitcoin collateral at scale.
