# 👥 Threshold Schnorr Signatures (TSS)

Surge leverages **Threshold Schnorr Signatures (TSS)** for securing Bitcoin Taproot vaults (dVaults). TSS ensures that vault funds cannot be moved without quorum agreement among a distributed set of signers, preventing unilateral control or custody risk.

---

## Why Schnorr TSS Matters for dVaults

- **Taproot Compatibility** – Bitcoin’s Taproot (BIP340) mandates Schnorr signatures. TSS outputs must be indistinguishable from single-party Schnorr signatures to maintain privacy and efficiency.
- **Non-Custodial Guarantee** – No individual signer can move BTC; only a threshold of signers can jointly authorize a transaction.
- **Byzantine Robustness** – Vaults must remain operable even if some signers are malicious or offline. Abort conditions must be avoided to prevent capital lock-up.

## Lin22 vs. FROST

Two leading Schnorr TSS protocols were evaluated:

- **FROST (RFC 9591)** – Optimized for speed (2 signing rounds).
- **Lindell 2022 (Lin22)** – Optimized for robustness, with 3 signing rounds and full security proofs.

#### Comparison Table

| Property | **FROST** | **Lin22 (2022)** |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Signing Rounds** | 2 | 3 |
| **Security Proof** | **UC secure** (Universally Composable), but aborts if signers fail | **Full simulatability** with Fischlin ZKPs |
| **Abort Handling** | Protocol halts if any signer withholds | Identifies cheaters; reconstructs missing shares |
| **DKG Setup** | ~2 rounds (Pedersen VSS) | 5+ rounds (Feldman VSS, more secure) |
| **Best Case** | Highly efficient when all honest | Robust to faults |
| **Output** | BIP340 Schnorr | BIP340 Schnorr |

## Why Surge Chooses Lin22

Surge prioritizes **liveness and accountability** over lowest latency:

- **Abort = Dead Capital** – With FROST, one unresponsive or malicious signer can permanently lock a vault. Lin22 avoids this by enabling recovery.
- **Identifiable Misbehavior** – Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) provide cryptographic evidence of cheating, enabling automated slashing and signer rotation.
- **Reconstruction** – Honest signers can rebuild missing shares using Feldman Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) from the DKG phase.
- **Privacy Preserving** – Outputs remain indistinguishable from native Schnorr signatures, ensuring Taproot spends look standard.

## Lin22 Signing Flow in Surge

#### 1. Distributed Key Generation (DKG)
- Key shares are generated using **Feldman’s VSS**.
- Public commitments allow verification that shares are consistent.
- Result: A single Taproot public key with private shares held by signers.

#### 2. Signing Rounds

**Round 1 – Commitment**  
- Each signer selects a fresh random nonce and broadcasts a *hash commitment* to it.  
- Inclusion in this round is mandatory.

**Round 2 – Decommitment & Proof**  
- Signers reveal their nonces and provide **Fischlin Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**.  
- Invalid or missing proofs immediately flag the signer as malicious.

**Round 3 – Signature Shares**  
- Honest signers compute signature shares using their secret key share and nonce.  
- Coordinator verifies ZKPs and aggregates valid shares.  
- Final output: A single **BIP340 Schnorr signature**, valid for Taproot.

## Example: 3-of-4 Signing

- **FROST** → If one signer withholds a share, the protocol aborts. No valid signature can be produced.
- **Lin22** → The malicious signer is exposed by ZKP failure. Honest signers reconstruct the missing share via VSS and complete the signature.

Result: **dVault remains operable even under Byzantine conditions.**

**Surge adopts Lin22 for Schnorr TSS because resilience matters more than speed when securing Bitcoin collateral at scale.**
