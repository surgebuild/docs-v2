# ⏳ Unilateral Exit

The **Unilateral Exit** (also called the *Timelock Exit Path*) is the final Taproot branch in every dVault. It guarantees that the vault owner can always recover their BTC, even if all signers or the Execution State Machine (ESM) become unavailable.

This path enforces **sovereignty at the script level** - not by protocol promises, but by Bitcoin’s native time-lock logic.

## Why It Exists
All other dVault paths (Repayment and Liquidation) require multi party coordination:
- Repayment → borrower + signers co-sign.  
- Liquidation → signer set executes based on oracle attestations.  

If those external systems fail - signers go offline, oracle data stops updating, or the ESM halts - the user still needs a guaranteed way to recover funds.  
That’s what this Taproot leaf enforces: **after a fixed delay, the user can unilaterally spend the vault**.

## Script Logic

The unilateral exit leaf commits a simple, auditable Bitcoin script using `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV)`:

```bitcoin
# Timelock Exit Path
# Spendable by user only after predefined timelock expiry
AND(
    OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY,
    OP_DROP,
    OP_CHECKSIG(user_exit_key)
)
