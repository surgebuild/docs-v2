# ⏳ Escape Hatch / Unilateral Exit

## Programmable Spend Paths via Taproot + MAST
Each dVault defines **three independent spend paths**, encoded using MAST. This ensures Bitcoin-native programmability while keeping the on-chain footprint minimal.


| Path | Condition | Example Script |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Repayment** | User + Signer co-sign repayment when liabilities cleared. | `OP_CHECKSIGADD OP_EQUALVERIFY` |
| **Liquidation** | Triggered when CR < threshold; executed via Stability Pool. | `IF <oracle_CR_check> ELSE <liquidation_branch> ENDIF` |
| **Escape Hatch**| Time-locked unilateral exit by user, used if signers fail. | `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP <user_pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG` |
{/* | **Migration** | Reassigns control to a new signer set at epoch rotation. | `OP_IF <new_signer_pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG OP_ENDIF` | */}

## Failure Modes & Recovery
- **Signer Downtime**: Escape hatch allows users to unilaterally reclaim BTC after timelock expiry.
- **Oracle Failure**: Default conservative CR assumptions are enforced until feeds recover.
- **Execution Layer Halt**: Even if off-chain execution fails, BTC remains secure under Taproot conditions

This ensures BTC is **always retrievable**, regardless of protocol failures.
