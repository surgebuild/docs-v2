# Cross-Chain Communication
Surge aggregates stablecoin liquidity across multiple ecosystems while **BTC remains locked on Bitcoin**.  
Surge deploys to existing chains and uses native messaging for stablecoins.

## Liquidity Movement
Surge integrates **Circle’s CCTP v2** for native stablecoin transfers.  
- Liquidity pools are maintained on one chain.  
- Stablecoin liquidity can move seamlessly to supported chains.  
- Initial support targets **Ethereum**, with expansion planned to more ecosystems.  

## Stablecoin Payouts
- When a vault issues debt, the execution environment requests stablecoin payout via CCTP.  
- BTC remains locked in its dVault; only stablecoins move cross-chain.  

## Redemptions
- When debt is repaid, execution verifies repayment and allows BTC release via repayment path.  
- **HTLC/adaptor signatures** ensure BTC unlock only occurs if stablecoin settlement is cryptographically confirmed.  

## Stability Pools
- Reserve of stablecoins used to absorb bad debt.  
- In liquidations, BTC is sold to Stability Pool at discount.  
- **Micro-liquidations** ensure only the amount needed to rebalance CR is sold, preserving most of user’s position.  

## Proofs & Audits
- **Proof-of-Reserves** → BTC UTXOs tracked on Bitcoin.  
- **Proof-of-Liabilities** → Debt registry published per block.  
- Combined, external parties can verify solvency in real-time.  

Cross-chain communication is designed to be **native, auditable, and failure-resistant**, enabling Surge to aggregate stablecoin liquidity across multiple ecosystems while keeping BTC locked on Bitcoin.
