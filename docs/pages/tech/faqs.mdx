<summary>**Why not use DLCs (Discreet Log Contracts)?**</summary>

DLCs are single-use oracle contracts designed for event-based payouts. Surge vaults are persistent and programmable, supporting recurring actions like borrow, repay, and partial liquidation.
DLCs can’t maintain live vault states or multi-party control, so Surge uses Taproot + MAST scripts for reusable native logic.

<summary>**Why not use a single key path instead of MAST spend paths?**</summary>

A single key path exposes all logic under one aggregated key, reducing flexibility and privacy.  
**MAST** allows each spend condition - repayment, liquidation, and escape to exist as a separate branch, revealing only the one used and keeping other logic hidden.

<summary>**What makes Surge non-custodial?**</summary>

Even if signers go offline or refuse to cooperate, users can still unilaterally recover BTC after a timelock using the Escape Hatch path. The non-custodial guarantee comes directly from Bitcoin script.

<summary>**Who controls the BTC?**</summary>

BTC stays in your dVault, which no single entity can spend. Even if signers go offline, the escape hatch lets you unilaterally recover it.

<summary>**Why does Surge use Lin22 instead of FROST?**</summary>

**Lin22** provides stronger fault tolerance and accountability.  
If a signer misbehaves, Lin22 generates cryptographic proof identifying who failed, allowing to exclude signer for next requests, slashing and signer rotation without relying on the coordinator
