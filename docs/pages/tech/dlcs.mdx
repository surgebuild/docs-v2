# ⚡ Why DLCs Don’t Work for Surge

Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) are a clever way to make Bitcoin respond to external data like the BTC/USD price - by letting an oracle decide which outcome becomes valid. That works well for **single-event contracts** (like “if BTC > $60k, pay Alice”), but Surge vaults are long-lived financial state machines. They need to handle multiple transactions - repayments, partial liquidations, and timeouts - from same vault address. 

## 1. Outcome Explosion  
In a DLC, every possible oracle result must be **predefined** with its own payout path. For lending, this means mapping *every* potential liquidation price to a unique address.  
Example:
```
Outcome 1 → 110000k
Outcome 2 → 109000k
...
Outcome 10 → 100100k ✅ (Sweep)
```
In a live system with continuous BTC price updates, the number of outcomes grows exponentially. Surge vaults need a **continuous collateral ratio**, not a finite list of precomputed addresses.

## 2. One Keypath per Outcome  
DLCs work by revealing a single keypath - the one matching the oracle’s outcome. Once that path is used, we can’t reuse the same address after the first event.  

## 3. Non-Persistent Lifecycle  
When a DLC settles, the address is “burned” - funds are swept, and the contract ends. A dVault keeps the same Taproot tree until final closure. Each dVault encodes its logic from the start.

## Summary

| Concept | DLC | dVault |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Outcome model | Discrete, precomputed | Continuous, protocol-driven |
| Keypath usage | One per outcome | Multiple reusable paths |
| Lifecycle | Single-use | Persistent |
| Oracle role | Executes payout | Attests to state |
| Address model | Burns on settle | Lives until closure |
