# 🔧 Technical Overview

Surge is a Bitcoin-native lending protocol built around programmable Taproot vaults, called **dVaults**. 

Each dVault locks BTC under predefined spend conditions that allow repayment, liquidation, or recovery. All logic is enforced by Bitcoin script - no wrapped assets or custodians.

A dVault is controlled jointly by the user and the **signer network**. Both parties must provide valid Schnorr signatures to authorize any movement of BTC. This shared control enables coordinated actions while maintaining full user custody at all times.

Surge uses an **Execution State Machine (ESM)** to coordinate vault logic and monitor collateral health. The ESM functions as a **deterministic contract layer** operated by decentralized signer nodes. It observes Bitcoin vault data, oracle prices, and signer attestations, then produces **state commitments** when spend conditions are satisfied.

When a vault’s collateral ratio drops below its threshold, the **liquidation path** is triggered.  BTC is spent to a **stability pool**, which absorbs the outstanding debt and receives BTC at a discount.  Other paths - **repayment** and **time-locked recovery (Unilateral exit)** - are enforced directly through Taproot conditions, ensuring execution by code, not trust.  

**Oracles** supply signed BTC/USD price feeds to the ESM. Signer nodes verify these updates before they modify vault state. Oracles cannot move funds - they only inform collateral calculations.
