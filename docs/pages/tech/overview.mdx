# 🔧 Technical Overview

Surge is a **Bitcoin native lending platform** that’s transparent, programmable, and built for grassroots Bitcoiners. BTC always locked in Taproot outputs with [MAST](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/mast/) based spend conditions, while execution programs mirror vault activity and coordinate stablecoin liquidity across chains.

| Domain | Role |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bitcoin Custody** | BTC secured under **Taproot + MAST conditions** through programmable dVaults. Each vault defines repayment, liquidation, and escape paths enforced by user + signer logic. |
| **Execution Program** | A hybrid **off-chain + on-chain coordination system** that mirrors vault state, enforces collateral ratios, manages signer epochs, and triggers liquidations or repayments. Deployed on EVM-compatible environments. |
| **Stability Pool** | A canonical pool that absorbs undercollateralized debt through partial (micro) liquidations and redistributes BTC proceeds or stablecoin yield to depositors. |
| **Cross-Chain Liquidity** | Routes stablecoin supply and repayment flows via **pluggable adapters**, starting with USDC (CCTPv2) and USDT, and extendable to other issuers. |

## Bitcoin Custody - dVaults

At the core of Surge are **dVaults** - Taproot outputs encoded with multiple spend paths using **MAST (Merklized Alternative Script Trees)**.
Only the executed branch is revealed, keeping vault logic private and efficient.

### Spend Conditions
- **Repayment** - borrower + signer quorum co-sign repayment to unlock BTC.
- **Liquidation** - signer quorum executes liquidation if collateral ratio < threshold.
- **Unilateral Exit** - borrower can reclaim BTC after `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` expiry.

### Security Properties
- **Bitcoin Native** - BTC collateral is always locked in Taproot outputs. Collateral never bridges or wraps.
- **Non-Custodial** - Users retain unilateral recovery through a timelocked escape path. No single signer or coordinator can move BTC.
- **Threshold Signatures** - Uses Lin22 Schnorr Signatures (via [cb-mpc](https://github.com/coinbase/cb-mpc)) for distributed signing, providing collusion resistance and auditability.
- **Oracle-Driven** - BTC/USD feeds govern collateral ratios and liquidation triggers.

## Execution State
Execution state **does not take custody of BTC** - it mirrors vault conditions on-chain and enforces protocol logic derived from Bitcoin transactions.

- **Event Mirroring** - Deposits, borrowings, repayments, and liquidations map 1:1 to Bitcoin spends.
- **Signer Epochs** - Tracks active signer sets, validates MPC signatures, and manages epoch rotation.
- **Collateral Monitoring** - Continuously monitors vault health via oracles. triggers liquidation when CR < MinCR.
- **Stability Pool Integration** - Absorbs undercollateralized debt and distributes discounted BTC to depositors.
- **PSBT Coordination** - During micro lot liquidations, the Execution Program constructs Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) representing each tranche of BTC collateral to be sold.

The program runs on existing EVM-compatible environments, ensuring deterministic state replication across chains.

## Cross-Chain Liquidity
Stablecoin liquidity moves freely across ecosystems while BTC remains locked on Bitcoin.

- **Canonical Events** - Standardized events (`AttestedDeposit`, `DebtIssued`, `DebtRepaid`, `LiquidationTriggered`) coordinate state across chains.
- **Deterministic Reconciliation** - Ensures stablecoin supply always matches BTC collateral locked in dVaults.
- **Adapter Based Routing** - Trustless routing through Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and more, with modular support for other issuers.

## End to End Model

- BTC is the **source of truth**, secured in Taproot outputs.
- Execution chains act as **state mirrors**, enforcing signer logic and collateral ratios.
- Users retain **sovereignty** through cooperative signer paths or unilateral exits for full recoverability.

This architecture enables **sovereign Bitcoin capital markets** - BTC secured by Taproot vaults, with programmable stablecoin liquidity and settlement across multiple chains.
