# 🔧 Technical Overview

Surge is a Bitcoin-native lending platform that's transparent, programmable, and designed to serve everyday Bitcoiners. BTC is always locked in Bitcoin contracts, while external execution environments mirror vault conditions and coordinate stablecoin liquidity across chains.

| Domain | Role |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bitcoin Custody** | BTC secured under Taproot + MAST conditions via dVaults. |
| **Execution Environment** | Mirrors vault state, enforces collateral ratios, and manages signer sets. |
| **Stability Pool** | Absorbs liquidations and redistributes BTC to stablecoin depositors. |
| **Cross-Chain Liquidity** | Routes stablecoin supply trustlessly via Circle CCTP v2. |

## Bitcoin Custody — dVaults

At the core of Surge are **dVaults**: Taproot outputs encoded with multiple spend paths using **MAST (Merklized Alternative Script Trees)**. Only the executed branch is revealed, preserving privacy and efficiency.

### Spend Conditions
- **Repayment** — borrower + signer quorum co-sign repayment to unlock BTC.
- **Liquidation** — signer quorum executes liquidation if collateral ratio < threshold.
- **Migration** — reassigns signer set under a new epoch.
- **Unilateral Exit** — borrower can reclaim BTC after `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` expiry.

### Security Properties
- **Bitcoin-native** — collateral never bridges; BTC never leaves Bitcoin.
- **Non-custodial** — no individual signer controls funds.
- **Threshold Signatures** — Lin22 Schnorr TSS (via [cb-mpc](https://github.com/coinbase/cb-mpc)) resists collusion or aborts.
- **Oracle-driven** — BTC/USD feed governs collateral ratios and liquidation triggers.

## Execution Environment

External chains **do not custody BTC** — they only mirror vault conditions and enforce protocol logic.

- **Event Mirroring** — deposits, debt issuance, repayments, and liquidations map 1:1 to Bitcoin spends.
- **Signer Epochs** — track signer rotations, validate signatures against the active set.
- **Collateral Ratios** — monitor vault health via oracles; liquidation events reconcile against Bitcoin.
- **Stability Pool** — depositors absorb undercollateralized debt and receive discounted BTC.

Execution runs on existing EVM-compatible chains with deterministic consensus (`reth` + CometBFT) for consistent state replication.

## Cross-Chain Liquidity

Stablecoin supply moves across ecosystems while BTC remains locked:

- **Circle CCTP v2** — routes liquidity across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and more.
- **Canonical Events** — standardized signals (`AttestedDeposit`, `DebtIssued`, `DebtRepaid`, `LiquidationTriggered`) form the audit log.
- **Deterministic Reconciliation** — ensures stablecoin supply always matches BTC collateral locked in dVaults.


## End-to-End Model
- BTC is the **source of truth**, locked in Taproot contracts.
- Execution chains act as **state mirrors**, coordinating signer rules and debt balances.
- Users retain **sovereignty**: cooperative signer flows or unilateral exits guarantee recoverability.

This architecture enables **sovereign Bitcoin capital markets** — BTC secured by Taproot contracts, with programmable stablecoin liquidity and settlement across multiple chains.
