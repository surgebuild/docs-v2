# 🔧 Technical Overview

Surge is a Bitcoin-native credit line built around programmable Taproot vaults, called **dVaults**. 

Each dVault locks BTC under predefined scripted conditions that allow repayment, liquidation, & unilateral exit. All logic is enforced by Bitcoin script, without wrapped assets or custodians.

A dVault is controlled by the user and the decentralized **signer network**. Both must provide Schnorr signatures to authorize any movement of BTC, ensuring coordination without compromising user custody.

Surge uses an Execution State Machine (ESM) to coordinate vault logic and monitor collateral health. The ESM functions as a deterministic coordination layer operated by signer nodes. It observes Bitcoin vault data, oracle price feed, and signer proofs, then produces verifiable state commitments when spend conditions are satisfied.

When a vault’s collateral ratio (CR) drops below its safety threshold, the **liquidation path** activates automatically.  BTC is spent to a **unified liquidity pool**, which absorbs the outstanding debt and receives BTC at a discount.  Other paths **repayment** and **time locked recovery (Unilateral exit)** are enforced directly through Taproot conditions, ensuring execution by code, not trust.
