# 🔧 Technical Overview

Surge is a Bitcoin‑native stablecoin access layer with a two‑plane design: the control plane on Bitcoin holds BTC; the execution plane on an EVM chain manages positions and settlement.

## Bitcoin Layer — Taproot dVaults

At the core of Surge are **dVaults**: Taproot outputs programmed with multiple authorized spend paths using **MAST (Merklized Alternative Script Trees)**. Only the executed branch is revealed, preserving privacy and efficiency.

### Spend Conditions
- **Repayment** — borrower + signer quorum co-sign repayment and unlock BTC.
- **Liquidation** — signer quorum executes liquidation if collateral ratio < threshold.
- **Migration** — reassigns signer set under new epoch.
- **Unilateral Exit** — borrower recovers BTC unilaterally after `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` timelock expiry.

### Security Properties
- **Bitcoin-native** — collateral never bridges; BTC never leaves Bitcoin.
- **Non-custodial** — no individual signer controls funds.
- **Threshold Signatures** — Lin22 Schnorr TSS (via [cb-mpc](https://github.com/coinbase/cb-mpc)) ensures robustness against aborts and malicious signers.
- **Oracle-driven** — BTC/USD feed determines collateral ratios and liquidation triggers.

| Layer | Role |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bitcoin Layer** | Native BTC custody under Taproot + MAST conditions. |
| **Execution Layer** | Universal ledger (reth + CometBFT) for liabilities and signer rules. |
| **Stability Pool** | Canonical single-chain pool resolving liquidations. |
| **Cross-Chain Layer**| Stablecoin routing via CCTP v2 across multiple execution chains. |

## Execution and Reconciliation

External execution environments exist only to **reflect and coordinate Bitcoin vault state**. They do not custody BTC.

- **State Mirroring** — records deposits, debt issuance, repayments, and liquidations as canonical events, mapped 1:1 to Bitcoin spends.
- **Signer Epochs** — tracks signer rotations and ensures signatures align with the active set.
- **Collateral Ratios** — monitors CR from oracle feeds; liquidation triggers are reconciled against actual Bitcoin conditions.
- **Stability Pool** — stablecoin depositors absorb undercollateralized debt and receive discounted BTC through liquidation flows.

These execution environments run on existing EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.), using deterministic consensus (`reth` + CometBFT) to maintain consistent state across validators.

## Cross-Chain Liquidity

Stablecoin liquidity moves across ecosystems while BTC remains locked on Bitcoin:

- **Circle CCTP v2** — bridges stablecoin liquidity across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and others.
- **Canonical Events** — standardized events (`AttestedDeposit`, `DebtIssued`, `DebtRepaid`, `LiquidationTriggered`) serve as the auditable ledger.
- **Deterministic Reconciliation** — ensures stablecoin supply across chains always maps exactly to BTC collateral locked in dVaults.
---

## End-to-End Model
- BTC is always the source of truth, locked in Taproot contracts.
- External chains execute state machines that mirror Bitcoin vault conditions.
- Users retain sovereignty: cooperative signer flows or unilateral exit guarantee recoverability.


This architecture enables **sovereign Bitcoin capital markets**: BTC secured by Taproot contracts, with programmable stablecoin liquidity and settlement across multiple chains.
