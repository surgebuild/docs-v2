# 🔧 Technical Overview

Surge is a **Bitcoin-native stablecoin access layer**.

Its architecture combines three layers,

## Bitcoin Layer

- BTC collateral is locked in Taproot **dVaults** (MAST based programs).
- Coins never leave Bitcoin and can move only via predefined **spend conditions**:
  - **Repayment**
  - **Liquidation** (if CR < threshold)
  - **Signer migration**
  - **Time-locked escape hatch** (`OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`)
- A BTC/USD **oracle** drives CR checks and liquidation triggers.

## Signer Layer

- All BTC spends require a quorum of MPC signers using battle tested Coinbase's **cb-mpc** open source framework.
- **Lin22** → Threshold Schnorr Signatures (Taproot). **Hai+18** → Threshold ECDSA Signatures.
- No unilateral control, signer **epochs** and **attestations** are tracked on-chain.
- Initial signers set are permissioned, roadmap toward **permissionless** enrollment.

## Execution Layer

- Programmable, **EVM compatible** layer (reth) with **CometBFT** for deterministic state.
- Surge deploys to existing chains.
- The ledger maintains vault state, debts, **stability pool** balances, and signer epochs
- Deterministic state transitions ensure BTC movements align with stablecoin flows.

## Liquidity & Cross-Chain

- Circle **CCTP v2** moves USDC liquidity natively across chains (Ethereum first, more to follow).
- A **canonical stability pool** on the primary chain absorbs bad debt and receives discounted BTC; funded by stablecoin lenders.

This layered design anchors Surge in Bitcoin’s security, while offering programmability, stablecoin connectivity, and institutional-grade auditability.
