# 🔧 Technical Overview

Surge is a Bitcoin‑native stablecoin access layer with a two‑plane design: the control plane on Bitcoin holds BTC; the execution plane on an EVM chain manages positions and settlement.

## Bitcoin

- BTC collateral is held in Taproot dVaults (MAST) — see <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/m/merkelized-alternative-script-tree-mast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="opacity-80 hover:opacity-100 hover:underline cursor-pointer transition-colors">MAST</a>.
- Funds move only via preset spend paths:
  - Repay: borrower + signer quorum signatures
  - Liquidate: when collateral ratio falls below threshold
  - Expiry: time‑lock via `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` after the loan term
- BTC/USD price oracle drives CR checks and liquidation triggers.
- Signer quorum uses MPC threshold signatures via <a href="https://github.com/coinbase/cb-mpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="opacity-80 hover:opacity-100 hover:underline cursor-pointer transition-colors">cb‑mpc</a> (Schnorr on Taproot; ECDSA where needed).
- Non‑custodial: no single party can move funds; either borrower + quorum, or timelock after expiry.

## Execution

- EVM‑compatible chain. We use reth for EVM execution and CometBFT for consensus/finality.
- Deployed to existing chains; contracts record vaults, debts, stability‑pool balances, and signer epochs.
- On‑chain state mirrors Bitcoin spends/events; transitions are reconciled 1:1 with BTC movements.
- Stability Pool: one pool covers shortfalls, acquires liquidated BTC at a discount, funded by stablecoin depositors.
- Signer set starts permissioned with a roadmap to permissionless enrollment.

## Cross‑Chain Liquidity

- USDC flows via Circle CCTP v2 across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and others.
- BTC never bridges. Only stablecoins move between chains; BTC stays on Bitcoin.
- Canonical events provide an auditable ledger of vault state, debt, stability‑pool balances, and signer epochs.
- Deterministic reconciliation ensures on‑chain stablecoin flows match underlying BTC movements.

This split keeps BTC on Bitcoin while enabling programmable settlement on EVM, with end‑to‑end auditability.
