# 🔧 Technical Overview

Surge is a Bitcoin-native stablecoin access layer.  
Its architecture combines three core components:

- **Bitcoin Layer**  
  BTC collateral is locked in Taproot vaults (`dVaults`) with program conditions.  
  Coins never leave Bitcoin and can only move under predefined conditions.  

- **Signer Network**  
  BTC spends require a quorum of MPC signers using Coinbase’s [cb-mpc](https://github.com/coinbase/cb-mpc) library.  
  - **Lin22** → Threshold Schnorr signatures.  
  - **Hai+18** → Threshold ECDSA signatures.  
  Initial signers are permissioned, but Surge will move toward permissionless signups.  

- **Execution Environment**  
  Surge runs a **programmable execution environment** that is EVM-compatible.  
  - Validators run **reth** with **CometBFT/Tendermint** consensus.  
  - The ledger tracks vaults, debts, stability pools, and signer epochs.  
  - Deterministic state transitions ensure BTC movements align with stablecoin flows.  

- **Liquidity & Cross-Chain**  
  Surge integrates Circle’s **CCTP v2** to move stablecoin liquidity natively between chains.  
  Liquidity pools are maintained on a primary chain and extended to Ethereum first, with more chains to follow.  

This layered design anchors Surge in Bitcoin’s security, while offering programmability, stablecoin connectivity, and institutional-grade auditability.
