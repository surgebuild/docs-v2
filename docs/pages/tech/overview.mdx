# 🔧 Technical Overview

Surge is a **Bitcoin-native stablecoin access layer** built around a **two-plane architecture** that separates BTC custody from stablecoin programmability.

## Control Plane (Bitcoin)

- BTC collateral is locked in Taproot **dVaults** (MAST based programs).
- BTC never leaves Bitcoin and can move only via **Deterministic spend conditions**:
  - **Repayment** requires borrower + signers signatures
  - **Liquidation** (if CR < threshold)
  - **Time-locked** (`OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`) for the loan duration
- A BTC/USD **oracle** drives CR checks and liquidation triggers.
- **Signer layer security**, All BTC spends require quorum approval from MPC signers using Coinbase’s cb-mpc framework.
  - **Lin22** → Threshold Schnorr (Taproot)
  - **Hai+18** → Threshold ECDSA
- **Non-custodial guarantees** with no unilateral control user + quorum signers or fallback timelocks.

## Execution Plane (Surge Layer)

- Fully EVM compatible, built with reth and CometBFT for deterministic state
- Surge **deploys to existing chains**, recording vault states, liabilities, stability pool balances, and signer epochs
- State transitions on the Surge plane mirror BTC movements, ensuring 1:1 consistency between Bitcoin and stablecoin liabilities
- Stability Pool, A single on-chain pool absorbs bad debt, receives BTC at a discount, and is funded by stablecoin lenders
- Initial signers set is permissioned and roadmap toward **permissionless** enrollment.

## Cross-Chain Liquidity

- USDC-native flows supported via Circle’s CCTP v2 routes stablecoin liquidity across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and others
- BTC never bridges: Only stablecoins move cross-chain; BTC remains secured on Bitcoin.
- The ledger maintains vault state, debts, **stability pool** balances, and signer epochs
- Deterministic state transitions ensure BTC movements align with stablecoin flows.
- Institutional-grade auditability, Canonical events provide an open and verifiable ledger.

This layered design anchors Surge in Bitcoin’s security, while offering programmability, stablecoin connectivity, and institutional-grade auditability.
