# 🔧 Technical Overview

Surge is a Bitcoin native lending platform that's transparent, programmable, and designed to serve everyday Bitcoiners. BTC is always locked in Taproot outputs with MAST (Merklized Alternative Script Trees) based spend conditions, while execution environments mirror vault conditions and coordinate stablecoin liquidity across chains.

| Domain | Role |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bitcoin Custody** | BTC secured under Taproot + MAST conditions via dVaults. |
| **Execution State** | Mirrors vault state, enforces collateral ratios, and manages signer sets. |
| **Stability Pool** | Absorbs liquidations and redistributes BTC to stablecoin depositors. |
| **Cross-Chain Liquidity** | Routes stablecoin supply trustlessly via issuer-authorized protocol |

## Bitcoin Custody - dVaults

At the core of Surge are **dVaults**: Taproot outputs encoded with multiple spend paths using **MAST (Merklized Alternative Script Trees)**. Only the executed branch is revealed, preserving privacy.

### Spend Conditions
- **Repayment** - borrower + signer quorum co-sign repayment to unlock BTC.
- **Liquidation** - signer quorum executes liquidation if collateral ratio < threshold.
- **Unilateral Exit** - borrower can reclaim BTC after `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` expiry.

### Security Properties
- **Bitcoin Native** - BTC Collateral is always locked in Taproot outputs. Collateral never bridges or never wraps.
- **Non Custodial** - no individual signer controls funds.
- **Threshold Signatures** - Lin22 Schnorr TSS (via [cb-mpc](https://github.com/coinbase/cb-mpc)) resists collusion or aborts.
- **Oracle Driven** - BTC/USD feed governs collateral ratios and liquidation triggers.

## Execution State

Execution state **do not custody BTC** - they only mirror vault conditions and enforce protocol logic.

- **Event Mirroring** - deposits, debt issuance, repayments, and liquidations map 1:1 to Bitcoin spends.
- **Signer Epochs** - track signers, validate signatures against the active set.
- **Collateral Ratios** - monitor vault health via oracles. Liquidation events reconcile against Bitcoin.
- **Stability Pool** - depositors absorb undercollateralized debt and receive discounted BTC.

Execution runs on existing EVM-compatible chains with deterministic program for consistent state replication.

## Cross-Chain Liquidity

Stablecoin supply moves across ecosystems while BTC remains locked:

- **Canonical Events** - standardized signals (`AttestedDeposit`, `DebtIssued`, `DebtRepaid`, `LiquidationTriggered`) form the audit log.
- **Deterministic Reconciliation** - ensures stablecoin supply always matches BTC collateral locked in dVaults.
- **Cross-Chain Liquidity** - Routes stablecoin supply and repayment flows across chains via pluggable adapters starting with USDC and USDT.


## End to End Model
- BTC is the **source of truth**, locked in Taproot outputs (using MAST scripts).
- Execution chains act as **state mirrors**, coordinating signer rules and debt balances.
- Users retain **sovereignty**: cooperative signer flows or unilateral exits guarantee recoverability.

This architecture enables **sovereign Bitcoin capital markets** - BTC secured by Taproot contracts, with programmable stablecoin liquidity and settlement across multiple chains.
