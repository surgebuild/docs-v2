# ⚙️ Execution Layer
The **Execution Layer** acts as Surge’s universal ledger for Bitcoin-backed liabilities. It connects Bitcoin vaults, signer rules, and stablecoin issuance into a deterministic state machine, ensuring that BTC collateral can only move when programmatic conditions are satisfied.

## Universal Ledger for BTC-Backed Liabilities
The Execution Layer maintains the **single source of truth** for:
- dVault collateral ratios.
- Active liabilities (stablecoin-denominated debt).
- Signer sets and epoch rotations.

It prevents rehypothecation by ensuring every Bitcoin UTXO is represented exactly once in system state, binding liabilities directly to on-chain BTC collateral.

## Implementation Details
- **Execution Engine**: `reth` provides an Ethereum-compatible state machine for programmability.
- **Consensus**: `CometBFT` delivers deterministic ordering and block finality across validators.
- **State Objects**:
  - `VaultState { collateral, debt, CR, signerSet }`
  - `StabilityPoolState { deposits, liquidationEvents }`
  - `CrossChainState { CCTP_transfers, attestations }`


Each finalized block produces a **state root**, which becomes the binding reference for signer permissions and BTC spend conditions.

## Bitcoin Aware State
The Execution Layer is deeply coupled to Bitcoin:
- **Oracle Feeds**: Medianized BTC/USD prices from trusted providers update collateral ratios.
- **Bitcoin Attestations**: Proof-of-inclusion for UTXOs and Taproot spends are submitted to validators, ensuring the ledger mirrors real Bitcoin state.

This guarantees that liabilities in Surge are always tied to **native Bitcoin collateral**, never synthetic abstractions.

## State Commitments and Root Binding
Every block finalizes a **state root** that encodes:
- Active vault positions and CR.
- Signer set and epoch key.
- Stability Pool balances.
- Cross-chain stablecoin flows.

BTC spends from a dVault are only valid if the signer set co-signs under the **aggregate Lin22 Schnorr key** bound to this state root. This creates a cryptographic anchor: collateral cannot move unless the Execution Layer authorizes it.

## Event Lifecycle
Canonical events drive all state transitions:

1. **AttestedDeposit** - A Bitcoin UTXO is confirmed and linked to a new VaultState.
2. **DebtIssued** - Stablecoins minted against collateral. liability recorded.
3. **DebtRepaid** - Stablecoins burned. VaultState updated, repayment spend unlocked.
4. **LiquidationTriggered** - CR < MinCR. StabilityPoolState updates. liquidation spend authorized.

These events form a deterministic log that validators replicate, ensuring consistency across the network.

## Signer Enforcement
Signer participation is tightly controlled:
- **Lin22 Schnorr Signing**: Coinbase cb-mpc coordinates threshold Schnorr rounds for Taproot keys.
- **Contract-Gated Authorization**: Signers may only sign if the Execution Layer has emitted a valid event.
- **No Rogue Signing**: Signers do not decide when BTC can move — the ledger enforces it.

This guarantees **programmatic enforcement of BTC custody**, not human discretion.
