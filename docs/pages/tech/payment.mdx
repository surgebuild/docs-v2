# 💳 Repayment Path

The **Repayment Path** is the primary Taproot leaf of a dVault. It defines how BTC leaves the vault when the loan is repaid. 

There’s no bridge, contract, or wrapped asset - just a Bitcoin spend that becomes valid when the correct signatures are presented.

## Script Anatomy

Each repayment branch commits the following tapscript at vault creation:

```bitcoin
# Repayment leaf
# User + signer network must co-sign with a Lin22 aggregated Schnorr key.
# The execution layer attests repayment but cannot move funds.
AND(
    OP_CHECKSIG(user_pubkey),
    OP_CHECKSIG(lin22_signer_set_key)
)
