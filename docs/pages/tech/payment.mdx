# 💳 Repayment Path

The **Repayment Path** is the normal closure path for of a dVault. It defines how BTC leaves the vault when the loan is repaid. There’s no bridge, contract, or wrapped asset - just a Bitcoin spend that becomes valid when the correct signatures are presented.

## How It Works

1. **Debt Reduction**
   - The borrower sends stablecoins (e.g., USDC) to the protocol treasury via the `Repay()` function.
   - The Execution Layer validates the transfer and updates the `debtUsd` field of the vault ledger.

2. **Collateral Unlock**
   - Once the repayment is confirmed, a release signal is emitted for a proportional BTC amount.
   - Signers verify the repayment event and co-sign a spend via the **Repayment ScriptPath** inside the Taproot tree.

3. **Full Repayment**
   - When total `debtUsd = 0`, the dVault can be fully unlocked.
   - The user + signer quorum co-sign the Bitcoin spend transaction.
   - BTC is returned to the depositor’s withdrawal address.

## Script Anatomy
Each repayment branch commits the following tapscript at vault creation:

```
# Repayment leaf
# User + signer network must co-sign with a Lin22 aggregated Schnorr key.
# The execution layer attests repayment but cannot move funds.
AND(
    OP_CHECKSIG(user_pubkey),
    OP_CHECKSIG(lin22_signer_set_key)
)
```

Repayment is the simplest — yet most important — path in Surge’s lifecycle, proving that Bitcoin can be used as dynamic collateral without leaving its native chain.
