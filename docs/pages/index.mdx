# 👋 Bitcoin-native Credit Line

## Why can't Bitcoin-backed lending be on-chain?

Most Bitcoin lending platforms were built for a different era, designed for early whales, miners, and institutions from the 2013 and 2017 cycles. 
They are custodial by design, opaque in operation, and misaligned with the values that make Bitcoin what it is.

**But a new wave of Bitcoiners has emerged and they’ve been left behind.**

These are everyday holders, often with less than 10 BTC, who span continents and backgrounds. 
Some are in emerging markets, escaping inflation and capital controls. Others are in developed countries, choosing Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and rejecting custodians on principle.
What unites them is a commitment to sovereignty, openness, and the right to financial tools that match those values.

Today’s platforms don’t serve them. They rehypothecate deposits, obscure risk, and liquidate without transparency. 
They weren’t built for this cohort and they certainly weren’t built for the future.

## Surge: A Bitcoin-native Credit Line
Surge offers Bitcoiners something different: a Bitcoin-native Credit Line that is transparent, decentralized, and trust-minimized. 
Built from the ground up for self-custody and programmable control, Surge enables Bitcoiners to borrow stablecoins without giving up ownership or compromising on the values that brought them to Bitcoin in the first place.

It’s not just about accessing liquidity, it’s about doing so without selling your Bitcoin, without intermediaries, and without hidden risk. 

With Surge, you:
- Borrow against your Bitcoin directly on-chain
- Control a programmable dVault verified by Taproot + threshold signatures
- Interact with an open marketplace powered by LPs, not black-box institutions

Surge is not a rebrand of legacy lending. It’s a reimagination - a protocol for the real Bitcoiners of today.

## What Comes Next

These technical docs walk through how Surge works - step by step. From how Bitcoin stays under non-custodial control, to how market-driven liquidity pools enable competitive borrowing terms, to how the system remains open, verifiable, and rehypothecation-free.

Surge is not just infrastructure. It’s a promise:

**Never sell your Bitcoin, ever.**
