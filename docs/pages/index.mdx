# Introduction

### Unlocking Bitcoin's Lending Future

The Bitcoin-backed lending market today is dominated by legacy platforms—opaque, centralized, and built for a narrow segment of users: high-net-worth individuals and institutions. 
These platforms, born in the previous crypto cycles, carry forward flaws like hidden rehypothecation, double-digit borrowing costs, and predatory liquidation mechanisms. 
More critically, they exclude the everyday Bitcoiner—those holding less than 10 BTC—who are often seeking stablecoins for everyday needs, emergencies, or lifestyle upgrades.

Bitcoin’s limited scripting capability has historically constrained innovation in lending, enabling CeFi incumbents to flourish unchecked. 
But a shift is underway. Advances in collaborative custody (via multi-sig and MPC), script-based programmability (via Taproot and Tapscript), and trust-minimized contract enforcement (via DLCs and threshold cryptography) 
are changing what’s possible. Surge is at the forefront of this transformation.

Surge is a Bitcoin-native lending platform that's transparent, programmable, and designed to serve a broader range of Bitcoiners. 
At its core lies the dVault: a decentralized, programmable vault architecture built with Tapscript (BIP342) and threshold signature schemes (TSS), governed by 20+ decentralized signers. 
These vaults are non-custodial, verifiable on-chain, and enforce loan terms like repayment, liquidation thresholds, and time locks without intermediaries.

Surge integrates a Bitcoin-aware EVM execution environment that powers an open lending marketplace, where market dynamics dictate borrowing terms, not central intermediaries.
Bitcoiners can access stablecoins against their BTC, knowing their funds are not rehypothecated and their positions are governed transparently by programmable logic and decentralized governance.

In short, Surge is building the future of lending on Bitcoin, one that is trust-minimized, transparent, market-driven, and inclusive.

Let’s make Bitcoin-backed lending open, verifiable, and accessible—for everyone.
