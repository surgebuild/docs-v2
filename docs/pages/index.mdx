# 👋 Introducing Surge

## Why can’t Bitcoin-backed lending reflect Bitcoin’s values?
Bitcoin is trustless by design: transparent, decentralized, and self-sovereign. 
Yet the lending platforms that serve it are anything but. Custodial, opaque, and centralized, they rely on “trust-me" systems where users surrender their keys, visibility, and control. 
The result? A broken market where the most principled Bitcoiners, those who care about custody, verification, and openness are forced to compromise everything Bitcoin stands for just to access liquidity.

## Surge: A Bitcoin-native Credit Line
Surge offers Bitcoiners something different: a Bitcoin-native Credit Line that is transparent, decentralized, and trust-minimized. 
Built from the ground up for self-custody and programmable control, Surge enables Bitcoiners to borrow stablecoins without giving up ownership or compromising on the values that brought them to Bitcoin in the first place.

It’s not just about accessing liquidity, it’s about doing so without selling your Bitcoin, without intermediaries, and without hidden risk. 

With Surge, you:
- Borrow against your Bitcoin directly on-chain
- Control a programmable dVault verified by Taproot + threshold signatures
- Interact with an open marketplace powered by LPs, not black-box institutions

Surge is not a rebrand of legacy lending. It’s a reimagination - a protocol for the real Bitcoiners of today.

## What Comes Next

These technical docs walk through how Surge works - step by step. From how Bitcoin stays under non-custodial control, to how market-driven liquidity pools enable competitive borrowing terms, to how the system remains open, verifiable, and rehypothecation-free.

Surge is not just infrastructure. It’s a promise:

>**Never compromise your Bitcoin, ever.**
