# Introduction [Making Bitcoin Programmable]

Build BTCFi dApps without bridges, wrapped BTC, or custodial risk, while delivering a seamless, native experience for Bitcoin holders.


### BTCFi Builders Face Four Major Hurdles

1. **Custody Challenges**  
   Introducing Bitcoin into dApps often creates custodial risk by relying on third-party signers compromise of those signers can put user funds in jeopardy.

2. **Lack of Native Anchoring**  
   Bitcoin doesn’t natively anchor off-chain logic. Most solutions depend on external oracles or soft-verification methods, undermining trust-minimization at the base layer.

3. **Fragmented Developer Ecosystem**  
   Bitcoin’s scripting limits force developers to choose between clunky off-chain workarounds or unfamiliar new languages (e.g., Clarity, Motoko). This fragmentation and steep learning curve slow adoption.

4. **Poor User Experience**  
   Wrapped-BTC workflows are broken: users juggle multiple wallets, gas tokens, and blind-sign messages. The result is low engagement and high friction.

These hurdles leave today’s BTCFi UX inaccessible and overly complex for most users.


## So What’s Surge Building?

- **Minimal Custodial Risk**  
  Users keep full control of their keys, no bridges, no custodial intermediaries.

- **Bitcoin-Native Execution**  
  Off-chain computation is anchored directly on Bitcoin’s base layer, with no external trust assumptions.

- **EVM-Compatible Dev Environment**  
  Write smart contracts in Solidity using familiar tools and tap into Bitcoin’s security and liquidity.

- **Seamless BTCFi UX**  
  One wallet, one token, one interface , no gas tokens, no wrapped assets.
