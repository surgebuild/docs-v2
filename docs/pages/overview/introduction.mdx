# Introduction

### Unlocking Bitcoin's Lending Future

Surge is a **Bitcoin native infrastructure** that powers programmable vaults (`dVaults`) for
stablecoin rails and decentralized lending. At the core of Surge lies the `dVault` a unique
construct leveraging Bitcoin’s `Taproot` upgrade and secure threshold signature schemes (TSS)
to bring non-custodial, decentralized infrastructure to Bitcoin lending.

Surge functions as an **app-specific infra layer**, purpose built for a transparent, open, and
programmable Bitcoin lending market.

The current BTC lending market, largely shaped by legacy platforms from past bull cycles,
remains opaque and centralized, serving only a narrow audience typically high-net-worth
individuals (HNWIs) and institutions. Bitcoin’s limited programmability has historically
restricted innovation, allowing CeFi dominance to flourish. But things are changing. New
architectures using multi-signature setups, `MPC`s, and `DLC`s are advancing, and Surge is at
the forefront of this shift with its powerful dVault framework.

Whether you're a developer, investor, early adopter, or protocol researcher, if you believe
Bitcoin can do more than just sit in cold storage, **Surge is your on-ramp** to a more expressive
and trustless Bitcoin economy.
