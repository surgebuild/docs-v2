# Introduction [Making Bitcoin Programmable]

Surge is a Bitcoin-native infrastructure that powers programmable vaults ("dVaults") for
stablecoin rails and decentralized lending. At the core of Surge lies the dVault—a unique
construct leveraging Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade and secure threshold signature schemes
(TSS) to bring non-custodial, decentralized infrastructure to Bitcoin lending.

Surge is like an app-specific infra layer, purpose-built for a transparent, open, and
programmable Bitcoin lending market.

The current BTC lending market, largely shaped by legacy platforms from past bull cycles,
remains opaque, centralized, and serves only a narrow audience—typically high-net-worth
individuals (HNWIs) and institutions. Bitcoin’s limited programmability has historically
restricted innovation, allowing CeFi dominance to flourish. But things are changing. New
architectures using multi-signature setups, MPCs, and DLCs are advancing, and Surge is at
the forefront of this shift with its powerful dVault framework.

Whether you're a developer, investor, early adopter, or protocol researcher, if you believe
Bitcoin can do more than just sit in cold storage, Surge is your on-ramp to a more expressive
and trustless Bitcoin economy.
