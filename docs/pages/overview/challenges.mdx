# ⚔️ Key Challenges for Bitcoiners

Bitcoiners typically seek liquidity for:
- Unplanned expenses
- Long-term upside preservation
- Avoiding taxable events from selling BTC

Yet today’s products miss the mark. Challenges include:

- **Rehypothecation Risk**: BTC is often reused behind the scenes. Surge ensures full on-chain verifiability and 0 rehypothecation.
- **Predatory Liquidations**: Sudden price swings can wipe out users. Surge introduces programmable micro-liquidations that adjust dynamically.
- **Opaque Terms**: Centralized lenders dictate rates and terms. Surge enables market-driven, decentralized pricing.
