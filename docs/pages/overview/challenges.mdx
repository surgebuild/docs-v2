# 🧱 The Underserved Bitcoin Majority

When we talk about Bitcoin-backed lending, we have to ask—which Bitcoiners are we really talking about? Institutions and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) are already well served. 
They enjoy concierge-like access to custodial platforms, white-glove support, and direct channels to capital. For them, the higher convenience fees are worth the frictionless experience.

But this isn't who Surge is built for.

Surge is designed for the broader majority of Bitcoiners—those holding under 10 BTC, which accounts for over 3 million BTC or ~17% of the total supply (see distribution chart below).

These Bitcoiners face a dramatically different reality:

### Limited Access
Most lending platforms are built with HNWIs in mind. That means retail users face barriers like minimum loan amounts, strict onboarding requirements, or exclusion altogether. 
This leaves everyday Bitcoiners with very few trusted options.

### Higher Borrowing Costs

It’s not just that APYs are often in the double digits, it’s that loan terms, flexibility, and pool diversity are also worse. 
Because these borrowers lack size or institutional connections, they face disproportionately high borrowing costs.

### Rehypothecation Risk
Most centralized platforms do not disclose whether—or how—they reuse your Bitcoin. Even when rates are attractive, the risk is unknowable. 
For Bitcoiners, who are ideologically and financially committed to long-term holding, this is a fundamental contradiction.

### Predatory Liquidation
Black-box lending platforms come with opaque and automated liquidation logic. 
If your vault is breached due to overnight volatility, there’s no warning, no partial exit, no failsafe. 
Meanwhile, HNWIs may receive tailored notices, human intervention, or extended grace periods.

### Under-Served Market
The below 10 BTC segment is not a niche—it’s the heart of the Bitcoin user base. Yet most lending infrastructure ignores them. 
It's time for a system that puts them first.
