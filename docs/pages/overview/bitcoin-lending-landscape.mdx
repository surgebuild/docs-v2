# 🏗 Bitcoin Lending Landscape
## Market Breakdown

Bitcoin lending today is segmented into three core categories:

- **CeFi platforms**: Centralized, regulated, and focused primarily on large BTC holders. These platforms rely on custodians and often lack transparency.
- **DeFi models (Multisig, P2P, DLCs)**: Non-custodial and promising, but early-stage with UX and regulatory challenges.
- **Wrapped BTC on other chains**: Operate on Ethereum and other L1s with WBTC or similar, introducing bridge risks and custodial dependencies that Bitcoiners often avoid.

_The visual breakdown below illustrates the diversity of players and tech stacks in this market_:
