# 💵 Stablecoin Adoption

Bitcoin was born as peer-to-peer digital cash but over time, it has evolved into something far more powerful:
A base-layer currency, a hedge against inflation, digital gold, and the cornerstone of a future monetary standard.
We all want hyperbitcoinization, but it won’t happen overnight.

Until then, stablecoins are doing the heavy lifting.

They’re onboarding millions, replacing legacy rails, and acting as a bridge between fiat and crypto, between the world we live in, and the world Bitcoin is building.

## The Growth is Real
The stablecoin market has reached $288 billion today, and is projected to hit $2 trillion by 2028, according to the U.S. Treasury.
This isn’t just growth, it’s a macro transformation.

## What Stablecoins enable
- **Low-cost global payments:** They shrink the gap between transaction and settlement.
- **Instant finality:** Real-time, on-chain settlement without legacy delays.
- **Programmable finance:** Logic, automation, and smart contracts, finance meets software.

## Adoption Catalysts
Stablecoin momentum is only accelerating, thanks to two big tailwinds:
- GENIUS Act (2025): A landmark U.S. regulatory framework. While it introduces some centralization, it unlocks massive new markets and prevents collapses like Terra Luna.
- Institutional on-chain entry:
	- Arc Network by Circle
	- Tempo by Stripe
	- Plasma by Tether
	- USAT (U.S. Asset Token)

These are not just product launches. They are infrastructure shifts, bringing real users on-chain, beyond crypto’s degen sandbox.

## What this means for Bitcoin
Stablecoins don’t compete with Bitcoin, **they complement it.**
- They bring utility to payments, remittances, and financial access.
- They fuel demand for decentralized credit rails.
- They accelerate the need for Bitcoin-native alternatives to custodial lending.

As stablecoin adoption grows, so does the urgency for:
- Fewer intermediaries
- More on-chain visibility
- Lower costs
- Access for everyday Bitcoiners

This is the moment for a new category in Bitcoin lending: a transparent, programmable, Bitcoin-native credit market.
That’s what Surge is here to build.
