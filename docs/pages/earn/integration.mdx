# Earn SDK Integration Guide

This page is intentionally concise so wallet teams and AI tools can integrate quickly.

Important behavior:

- LPs deposit into the shared pool (not directly into a single market contract).
- Market routing is controlled with exposure settings (`setExposure` / `setExposures`).

## 1) Install

```bash
npm install @surgecredit/earn-sdk@latest viem
```

## 2) Initialize SDK

```ts
import { createWalletClient, custom } from "viem";
import { baseSepolia } from "viem/chains";
import {
  SurgeEarnClient,
  SURGE_BASE_SEPOLIA_CONFIG,
  createSurgeEarnPublicClient,
} from "@surgecredit/earn-sdk";

const publicClient = createSurgeEarnPublicClient("https://sepolia.base.org", baseSepolia);

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: baseSepolia,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum),
});

export const earn = new SurgeEarnClient({
  publicClient,
  walletClient,
  config: SURGE_BASE_SEPOLIA_CONFIG,
});
```

## 3) Read markets and user state

```ts
const address = "0xYourWalletAddress";

const [markets, position, exposures, usdcBalance] = await Promise.all([
  earn.listMarkets(),
  earn.getUserPosition(address),
  earn.getUserExposures(address),
  earn.getWalletUsdcBalance(address),
]);
```

## 4) Deposit flow (wallet invest)

```ts
const address = "0xYourWalletAddress";
const amountUsdc = "100";

const allowance = await earn.getAllowance(address);
if (allowance === 0n) {
  await earn.approveMaxUsdc({ account: address, waitForReceipt: true });
}

await earn.deposit({ amountUsdc, account: address, waitForReceipt: true });
```

Target a fixed market allocation in one flow:

```ts
await earn.depositAsLp({
  account: address,
  amountUsdc: "100",
  exposureUpdates: [{ marketId: 2, exposurePercent: 100 }],
  waitForReceipt: true,
});
```

## 5) Withdraw flow

```ts
await earn.withdrawByUsdc({
  amountUsdc: "25",
  account: "0xYourWalletAddress",
  waitForReceipt: true,
});
```

## 6) Activity feed

```ts
const activity = await earn.getUserActivity("0xYourWalletAddress", {
  includeTimestamps: true,
  limit: 25,
});
```

## 7) React hooks (optional)

```tsx
import { useEarnActivity, useEarnMarkets, useEarnPortfolio } from "@surgecredit/earn-sdk/react";

function EarnView({ client, address }: { client: any; address: `0x${string}` }) {
  const { data: markets } = useEarnMarkets(client, { pollIntervalMs: 15000 });
  const { data: portfolio } = useEarnPortfolio(client, address);
  const { data: activity } = useEarnActivity(client, { user: address, limit: 10, pollIntervalMs: 15000 });

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Markets: {markets.length}</div>
      <div>Current Value: {portfolio.position?.currentValue ?? 0}</div>
      <div>Recent Activity: {activity.length}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Integration checklist

- Wallet network is Base Sepolia (`chainId: 84532`)
- Reliable Base Sepolia RPC configured
- USDC token decimals treated as 6
- Wait for transaction receipts before refreshing UI
- Show tx hash and explorer link after write actions
