# Earn SDK Overview

`@surge/earn-sdk` is a JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for wallet teams and frontend apps that want to integrate Surge earn markets on Base Sepolia.

## What the SDK gives you

- Market discovery (`listMarkets`) with APR, TVL, utilization, LTV, and reserve data.
- User position reads (`getUserPosition`) including deposited value and LP token balance.
- Exposure reads (`getUserExposures`) to show per-market allocation and target exposure.
- Transaction helpers for approve, deposit, withdraw, and exposure updates.
- React hooks (`@surge/earn-sdk/react`) for easy frontend state integration.

## Default network configuration

The SDK ships with a default Base Sepolia config:

- Liquidity Pool: `0xA40C833639803132D409E344d1CB9A9DD5aAB411`
- USDC: `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e`

You can override both addresses if you deploy to a new environment.

## Install

```bash
npm install @surge/earn-sdk viem
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { baseSepolia } from "viem/chains";
import {
  SurgeEarnClient,
  SURGE_BASE_SEPOLIA_CONFIG,
  createSurgeEarnPublicClient,
} from "@surge/earn-sdk";

const publicClient = createSurgeEarnPublicClient("https://sepolia.base.org", baseSepolia);

const earn = new SurgeEarnClient({
  publicClient,
  config: SURGE_BASE_SEPOLIA_CONFIG,
});

const markets = await earn.listMarkets();
```

## Next step

Use the full [Integration Guide](/earn/integration) to wire wallet flows (approve/deposit/withdraw) and optional React hooks.
