# 🤝 For Distribution Partners

Surge’s credit market is **permissionless**: any distribution partner can integrate and offer borrow or earn products under their own brand. You get the same on-chain infrastructure—dVaults, the Decentralised Custody Network (DCN), and the liquidity layer—without building custody or lending from scratch.

## 🔌 Permissionless by design

- **No gatekeeping** - Integrate via public APIs and on-chain flows. No exclusive partnerships or approval gates required.
- **Same rails as Surge** - Your users tap the same Bitcoin-native credit market: programmable dVaults, oracle-driven liquidation, and multi-market liquidity (variable and fixed).
- **You own the experience** - Brand the UI, custody UX, and product packaging. Surge provides the settlement and risk infrastructure.

That makes it possible to **white-label** both borrowing (for your users who hold BTC) and earning (for your users who want to supply stablecoins) without operating custody or a lending book yourself.

## 📦 White-label borrow products

Offer BTC-backed credit under your brand:

- **Your app, Surge’s execution** - Integrate your wallet, lock BTC in a dVault, and draw stablecoins. You control onboarding, UX, and support; Surge and the DCN handle collateral verification, disbursement, and repayments.
- **Fixed or variable rate** - Plug into the variable pool or fixed-rate markets so you can offer the terms that fit your users (e.g. fixed 6% or floating).
- **Transparent and verifiable** - Each credit line is a Taproot UTXO; you can surface proof of non-custodial, unrehypothecated collateral to users and regulators.

Use cases: neobanks, wallets, exchanges, or any platform that wants to offer “borrow against your Bitcoin” without running the underlying credit and custody stack.

## 💰 White-label earn products

Offer yield on stablecoins under your brand:

- **Your brand, Surge’s liquidity layer** - Users supply USDC/USDT into the same pools that back the credit market. You design the product (e.g. “Savings” or “Earn”), Surge and the DCN handle pool accounting, rate setting, and liquidations.
- **Variable and fixed tranches** - You can offer floating yield from the variable pool or fixed-rate earn from fixed-rate markets, depending on what your users want.
- **Real yield from real credit** - Yield comes from borrower interest and (where applicable) liquidation economics, not token incentives or opaque leverage.

Use cases: savings apps, treasury products, or any distributor that wants “earn on stablecoins” backed by Bitcoin-collateralized credit, without operating the lending or custody infrastructure.

## 🔗 How to plug in

- **Technical integration** - Connect to Surge’s execution and liquidity layer via the public interfaces and APIs that power the credit market. Technical Documentation and integration patterns coming soon!
- **Compliance and UX** - You remain responsible for your jurisdiction’s rules, KYC/AML if applicable, and user communication. Surge provides verifiable on-chain data (collateral, rates, pool state) to support transparency and reporting.
- **Support and positioning** - You handle user support and positioning (e.g. “Powered by Surge” or fully white-labeled). Surge focuses on infrastructure and protocol integrity.
