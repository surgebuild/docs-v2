# 💰 For Stablecoin holders

## LPs Interface
Liquidity providers (LPs) play a critical role in the Surge ecosystem by supplying stablecoins to the lending market. 
Unlike traditional DeFi yield strategies centered around trading pools or speculative DeFi games, Surge offers real yield with real usage - driven by Bitcoiners borrowing against real BTC.

### 💡 Why Surge for LPs?

Today, most stablecoin yield opportunities revolve around trading activity and are largely tied to the Ethereum ecosystem, which is saturated and increasingly limited to early adopters. 
Platforms like Aave and Compound dominate, but offer diminishing returns.

Surge opens access to a new and underserved market - Bitcoin-backed lending, previously gated behind CeFi platforms working only with institutions and HNWIs. 
With regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act, the opportunity to offer predictable, stable, and transparent yield is now possible.

Surge democratizes access to this yield stream for all LPs - not just institutions.

### 🛠️ How It Works
LPs access an integrated interface to provide stablecoin liquidity across supported chains and assets. 
They can:

- Contribute to default pooled liquidity, which is used to fulfill loan requests by Bitcoiners
- Choose preferred stablecoins, terms, and destination chains
- Withdraw or rebalance positions based on market demand

Liquidity is deployed only when there is actual borrower demand - creating an efficient, on-chain supply/demand mechanism.

### 🏦 For Larger LPs & Institutions
Institutional LPs or large stablecoin holders can create custom liquidity pools with their own terms. 
These private or semi-public pools allow them to:

- Set their own interest rates and loan conditions
- Define risk parameters and collateral rules
- Capture yield from BTC-backed loans at scale

This unlocks a powerful yield source that is:
- Non-speculative
- Transparent and auditable
- Compliant with emerging stablecoin frameworks


Surge allows LPs of all sizes to participate in a new class of Bitcoin-native lending - bridging capital with on-chain demand securely and programmatically.

### 💧 Stability Pools
Surge introduces micro-liquidation, a gradual, rule-based process that avoids full-position wipeouts. 
Liquidation occurs through stability pools, and may be triggered by:

- Extreme BTC price volatility breaching collateral thresholds
- Failure to maintain minimum repayment and health score
- Complete loan default, in which case the dVault is absorbed by the protocol as bad debt

This approach ensures fairness, minimizes losses, and aligns incentives between lenders, borrowers, and network participants.
