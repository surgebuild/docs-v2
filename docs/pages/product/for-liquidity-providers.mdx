# 💰 For Liquidity Providers

Surge introduces a novel liquidity pool architecture, managed by a Decentralised Custody Network (DCN). 
These pools act as the communication layer between BTC and stablecoin capital, enabling Bitcoiners to draw credit lines while LPs earn real yield from actual credit usage.

Unlike traditional DeFi platforms that rely on speculative trading activity, Surge enables LPs to earn predictable, usage-driven yield, with added incentives for participating in network operations like liquidations.


## 🧩 The Architecture: LP Pools + DCN

At the heart of Surge’s lending mechanism is a multi-chain, DCN-coordinated communication layer:
- Liquidity pools exist natively in stablecoins (USDC, USDT) on Ethereum/Base or other supported chains.
- When a Bitcoiner requests a credit line, the DCN verifies BTC collateral on-chain, signs a Bitcoin transaction, and authorizes the stablecoin disbursement.
- The DCN jointly maintain custody policies, validate credit conditions, and enforce programmatic rules for repayment, liquidation, and timelocks.

The DCN effectively bridges Bitcoin and Ethereum/Base trust-minimized, with no wrapping or custodial middlemen.


## 📊 LP Dashboard & DCN Participation

LPs interact through an intuitive web interface to:
- Deposit supported stablecoins into active liquidity pools
- Monitor pool health, active credit lines, interest accrued, and risk metrics
- Configure preferences like pool size, chain, stablecoin, and duration
- Join the queue to run a Distributed Custody node

Running a Distributed Custody node is optional, but highly encouraged for active LPs. It enables:
- Priority yield opportunities and liquidation incentives
- Visibility into on-chain conditions and vault-level transparency


## 💰 Why LPs Choose Surge
- Untapped Bitcoin-native demand - Yield from BTC-backed credit lines previously gated behind CeFi platforms
- Competitive, real yield - Interest paid by Bitcoiners drawing credit, not speculative APYs
- Liquidation bonuses - 5% liquidation premium on undercollateralized positions goes to pools
- Compliant-ready design - Surfaces under the GENIUS Act framework for stablecoin operations
- Build your Bitcoin treasury - Grow BTC position by providing fiat liquidity
- Grow your Bitcoin treasury - 5% liquidation premium on purchasing undercollateralized positions

Unlike ETH-centric DeFi or risky alt-L2 plays, Surge offers Bitcoin-first, credit-driven utility that compounds over time.

Surge brings yield back to the fundamentals: real users, real assets, and verifiable on-chain logic, not token games or circular lending.
