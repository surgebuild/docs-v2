# 🖼️ Product Overview
Surge is a Bitcoin-native credit line powered by taproot-based UTXOs, where every credit line is a dedicated UTXO with two signers: the Bitcoiner and a Decentralised Custody Network (DCN).

## How it Works
Each Bitcoiner sends BTC to a unique dVault, a Taproot-based, programmable vault. 
This vault enforces three deterministic spending paths:

1. **Voluntary Repayment:** If no credit is drawn, or once the borrower repays, they can withdraw BTC directly, without signer network intervention. 
2. **Liquidation:** If the credit line health drops below safe thresholds, the DCN can co-sign a liquidation transaction, only when validated by external oracle attestations.
3. **Delinquent:** If the credit line is not paid off or rolled over at the end of term, the DCN can sign a liquidation transaction, BTC will be sold to cover debt + interest and the remained returned.
4. **Transfer:** Bitcoiners may transfer loans to and from Surge's credit market. This requires signitures from the Bitcoiner, DCN, and a third party credit provider.
5. **Time-Locked Recovery:** If the system becomes unresponsive or the DCN go offline, the BTC becomes spendable by the user after a pre-set time lock.

This ensures that funds are always:
- Non-custodial – user remains in control
- Verifiably on-chain – visible and auditable at all times
- Decentralized – DCN is distributed and economically aligned

Once the BTC is locked, stablecoin liquidity is released from the Ethereum-based pool Base (starting with USDC, USDT), sent directly to the borrower's wallet. 
It’s a peer-to-pool system where Bitcoiners tap liquidity, and LPs earn yield, with infrastructure ensuring safety and execution.

## Interface Suite

Surge has three core interfaces, each designed for a key participant:
- **Bitcoiners:** Access their credit line via Surge’s mobile app (iOS, Android; PWA coming soon) or via a distribution partner. No paperwork, just verifiable BTC and stablecoin access in less than 30 minutes.
- **Liquidity Providers:** Contribute stablecoins into pools, earn fixed yields, and optionally run signer nodes in our DCN to power the system.
- **Distributed Custody Network Members:** Access technical data, audit trails, oracle feeds, system status, and open-source repos via surge.build, our transparency hub.

Surge is built ground-up for trust-minimized credit and no one can touch their Bitcoin without following predefined, public rules.
