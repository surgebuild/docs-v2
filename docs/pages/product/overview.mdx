# 🖼️ Product Overview
Surge is fundamentally a decentralized lending marketplace, where Bitcoiners, stablecoin holders, and infrastructure providers collaborate to enable transparent, on-chain lending—without intermediaries.

The Surge product suite comprises three core interfaces:

- **Borrow Interface** for Bitcoiners seeking liquidity against their BTC
- **LPs Interface** for stablecoin holders and LPs looking to earn yield
- **Infra Provider Tools** for validators, signers, and network operators powering the decentralized backend

At the core of all this is dVaults, decentralized, programmable Bitcoin vaults built using Tapscript and secured via lin22, a threshold signature scheme (TSS) protocol. 
These vaults ensure Bitcoin stays verifiably on-chain and unrehypothecated.

Another critical innovation is Surge’s Bitcoin-aware execution layer, which manages the lending lifecycle—origination, repayment, liquidation—on-chain, 
cutting out the need for manual oversight or off-chain risk.

In the following sections, we’ll dive into the key features of each product interface and how they work together to create a new standard for Bitcoin-native lending.
