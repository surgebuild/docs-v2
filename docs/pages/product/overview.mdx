# 🖼️ Product Overview

Surge is a **multi-sided Bitcoin-native lending marketplace** that connects three key participants:

- **Bitcoiners**: Borrow stablecoins without selling BTC or giving up custody.
- **Stablecoin Holders**: Earn sustainable yield by lending into decentralized pools.
- **Infrastructure Providers**: Secure dVaults, validate execution, and manage liquidations.


At the core of Surge are **dVaults** - decentralized, programmable vaults built directly on Bitcoin using **Taproot + Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS)**. These vaults ensure BTC never leaves the Bitcoin network, while enabling stablecoin settlement across EVM-compatible chains.
