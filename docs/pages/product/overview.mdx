# 🔍 Product Overview

Surge is a **multi sided lending marketplace** that brings together:  

- **Bitcoiners:** looking to borrow stablecoins without giving up custody  
- **Stablecoin holders:** looking to earn yield on-chain in a decentralized way  

The entire system is powered by **dVaults** decentralized, programmable vaults native to Bitcoin and governed by Taproot + TSS.  

## For Bitcoiners  

- Connect your existing self-custodial wallet (e.g., Unisat) or create a new vault-linked wallet via social credentials.  
- Spin up a dVault that is governed by your signature, a threshold signer set, and custom policy rules.  
- Choose a lending pool to borrow stablecoins under your preferred terms.  
- Receive stablecoins on the chain of your choice (e.g., Ethereum initially).  
- Liquidation is **non-destructive** executed in micro steps.  
- **Full visibility** verify your BTC remains untouched and on-chain.  

## For Stablecoin Holders  

- Lend stables into default or custom pools.  
- Earn yield (starting at **7%+ APY**), with automated or manual risk profiling.  
- Use Surge’s interface to manage deposits, redemptions, and pool terms.  
- Participate in **Stability Pools** to manage liquidations.  
- Withdrawals can be time-gated to manage volatility and usage.
