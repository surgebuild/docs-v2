# 🖼️ Product Overview
Surge is a Bitcoin-native credit line powered an advanced multisig wallet, where every credit line is a dedicated vault with two parties: the Bitcoiner and a distributed signer network that manages liquidity and enforces loan logic.

## How it Works
Each Bitcoiner sends BTC to a unique dVault, a Taproot-based, programmable vault secured via a threshold signature network (lin22). 
This vault enforces three deterministic spending paths:

1. **Voluntary Repayment:** If no credit is drawn, or once the borrower repays, they can withdraw BTC directly—without signer intervention.
2. **Liquidation:** If the loan health drops below safe thresholds, the signer network can co-sign a liquidation transaction, only when validated by external oracle attestations.
3. **Time-Locked Recovery:** If the system becomes unresponsive or signer nodes go offline, the BTC auto-returns to the user’s wallet after a pre-set time lock.

This ensures that funds are always:
- Non-custodial – user remains in control
- Verifiably on-chain – visible and auditable at all times
- Decentralized – signer network is distributed and economically aligned

Once the BTC is locked, stablecoin liquidity is released from Ethereum-based pools (starting with USDC, USDT), sent directly to the borrower. 
It’s a peer-to-pool system where Bitcoiners tap liquidity, and LPs earn yield, with infrastructure ensuring safety and execution.

## Interface Suite

Surge has three core interfaces, each designed for a key participant:
- **Bitcoiners:** Access their credit line via Surge’s mobile app (iOS, Android; PWA coming soon). No paperwork, no middlemen, just verifiable BTC and instant stablecoin access.
- **Liquidity Providers:** Contribute stablecoins into pools, earn fixed yields, and optionally run signer nodes to power the system and earn protocol fees.
- **Network Verifiers & Builders:** Access technical data, audit trails, oracle feeds, system status, and open-source repos via surge.build, our transparency hub.

Surge is built ground-up for trust-minimized lending, where users verify everything on-chain, and no one can touch their Bitcoin without following predefined, public rules.
