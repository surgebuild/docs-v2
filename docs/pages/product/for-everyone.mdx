# ✊ For Everyone  

Surge isn’t just for Bitcoiners and LPs. It’s for everyone who cares about building open, verifiable, and trust-minimized systems on Bitcoin.

We believe critical financial infrastructure must be transparent by default. That’s why we’re committed to making the following available for public review:

## 🧾 Distributed Custody Network Transparency
- Live list of active signer nodes
- Entity-level disclosure (who they are, why they’re trusted)
- Slashing history and performance metrics

## 📈 Oracle Feed Integrity
- Real-time oracle inputs powering LTV and liquidation
- Historical data and update cadence
- Circuit-breaker logic for edge cases

## 🔍 Verifiable Custody
- Every Bitcoiner’s credit line is backed by a unique Taproot address
- Anyone can verify that BTC is unrehypothecated and non-custodial

## 📑 Audits & Reports
- Ongoing third-party security audits
- Internal monitoring metrics
- Protocol health reports and governance insights

All of this will be published at [surge.build](https://surge.build): your window into how Surge operates under the hood.

>Because if it’s not verifiable, it’s not Bitcoin.
