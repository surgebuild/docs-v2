# ✊ For Bitcoiners

- Connect your existing self-custodial wallet (e.g., Unisat) or create a new vault-linked wallet via social credentials.  
- Spin up a dVault that is governed by your signature, a threshold signer set, and custom policy rules.  
- Choose a lending pool to borrow stablecoins under your preferred terms.  
- Receive stablecoins on the chain of your choice (e.g., Ethereum initially).  
- Liquidation is **non-destructive** executed in micro steps.  
- **Full visibility** verify your BTC remains untouched and on-chain.
