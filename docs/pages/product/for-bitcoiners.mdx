# ✊ For Bitcoiners

## Your Bitcoin, Your Terms.
Access a Bitcoin-native Credit Line, without giving up full-custody. It’s built for everyday Bitcoiners who value sovereignty, transparency, and verifiable custody, not centralized black boxes.

Your BTC stays in a unique, programmable Taproot vault, secured by a Decentralized Custody Network using threshold Schnorr signatures. 
It’s on-chain, auditable, and non-custodial, always.


## 🚀 How It Works
### 1. Sign Up Securely
Get started via mobile app on Android or iOS. Sign up with just an email + OTP. We create a secure, self-custodial wallet with built-in backup and 2FA for enhanced protection.

### 2. Request a Credit Line
Specify your initial credit line amount with
- Fixed interest rates (8–11% annually)
- Variable interest rates coming soon(6.9% target)
- A 12-month term with flexible repayment
- No need to draw full amount upfront, you control usage

### 3. Send Bitcoin
- A unique Taproot address is generated per credit line
- You deposit BTC at 50% LTV (e.g., send 0.1 BTC for $3K USDC credit)
- After 3 confirmations, your credit line becomes active

### 4. Draw & Repay Flexibly
- Withdraw stablecoins (USDC, USDT) to any address
- Spend, send, or off-ramp to a bank account
- Repay any time to reclaim your BTC
- Add more BTC to reduce LTV or unlock more credit

### 5. Stay Verifiably in Control
Your BTC is never moved without:
- Your signature, and
- the Distributed Custody Network signiture based on programmable vault logic

If the system fails or goes offline, your vault includes a time-locked refund path—returning your BTC to your wallet after term expiration.

### 6. Liquidation, but Fair
Liquidation with a rules-based process that only liquidates in extreme cases when BTC collateral health declines past 90%.
- Triggered only when on-chain oracles (like BTC/USD price) report sustained volatility
- Price feeds are transparent and open—you can verify exactly what data is being used
- Price feeds are double checked by DCN before liquidation begins

This means no surprise wipeouts, no discretionary calls—just fair, on-chain enforcement with double checks.


## 🔍 Built for Transparency

- **Taproot Vaults (dVaults):** Powered by threshold Schnorr signatures, enabling shared control and programmable enforcement.
- **Verifiable Collab-Custody:** You can inspect your vault and verify BTC remains unrehypothecated and on-chain.
- **Open System:** All terms, credit logic, and signer network info are transparent at [surge.build](https://surge.build)
- **Transparent Oracles:** Anyone can view the price feeds that govern loan health and liquidation triggers.

## 💡 Why Credit Line > Loan
Unlike traditional loans, Surge offers a flexible credit line:
- Borrow only what you need, when you need it
- Repay and reuse, no need to reapply
- Maintain control over your BTC with on-chain proof at every step

Surge is for Bitcoiners who believe in holding their keys and want access to liquidity without selling their future.
