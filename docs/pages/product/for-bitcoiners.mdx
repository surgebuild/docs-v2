# ✊ For Bitcoiners
Surge makes it possible to **borrow stablecoins against BTC** in a trust-minimized way:

1. **Connect a Wallet:** Use your existing self-custodial wallet (e.g., Unisat) or create a new vault-linked wallet with social login.

2. **Create a dVault:** Governed by **your signature + a threshold signer set**, with programmable policy rules encoded in Taproot scripts.

3. **Choose Lending Terms:** Access default lending pools or negotiate custom terms for stablecoin loans.

4. **Receive Stablecoins:** Borrow USDC delivered via CCTP to the chain of your choice (starting with Ethereum).

5. **Liquidation Safety:** Non-destructive liquidations executed in **micro-steps** through the Stability Pool, avoiding mass sell-offs.

6. **Full Visibility:** On-chain proofs guarantee that your BTC remains untouched inside your dVault at all times.
