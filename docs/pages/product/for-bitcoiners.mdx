# ✊ For Bitcoiners

## Borrow Interface
The Borrow Interface is where Bitcoiners interact directly with Surge to access stablecoin liquidity. 
It is designed with a trust-minimized, user-centric approach, powered by dVaults and the Bitcoin-aware programmable execution state.

### 🔐 Authentication
Users can access the interface via self-custodial Bitcoin wallets like Unisat, Xverse, and others. 
Alternatively, users can sign up using social login methods, in which case the authenticated identity manages access to the borrow interface. 
Both methods preserve user custody and transparency.

### 🏗️ Loan Initiation
Every loan begins with the creation of a dVault - a unique, Taproot-based vault secured collaboratively by the user and the decentralized signer network (TSS).
- A Taproot address is generated specifically for the loan.
- The user deposits BTC into this address.
- After standard Bitcoin block confirmations (~10 minutes), the BTC becomes collateral.

All BTC remains verifiable on-chain, and any movement requires:
- The user’s signature, and
- Authorization from the TSS signer network governed by programmed loan logic.

If a borrower defaults, only the program can execute transfer/liquidation logic - no centralized intervention is possible. This program is defined by a [deterministic liquidation framework](/tech/dvaults-liquidation), where every vault encodes pre-committed spend paths on Bitcoin.


### 💱 Request to Borrow Stablecoins
Bitcoiners can then browse available liquidity pools, which vary by:

- Stablecoin offered (e.g., USDC, USDT, etc.)
- Rates, terms, and liquidity depth
- Destination chain (Ethereum first, others later)

These pools are provided by LPs and market makers. All terms are visible and market-driven.

### 📊 Loan Management
Once stablecoins are disbursed, the loan is active and managed via Surge’s Bitcoin-aware execution state.

- Loan status, collateral health, and repayment history are visible on-chain.
- BTC remains verifiably locked in the dVault throughout the loan lifecycle.
- Users monitor their position health score, influenced by BTC volatility, repayment behavior, and loan-to-value ratios.
- Users can configure alerts via email (and more channels soon) to stay informed.

### 🔻 Collateral Liquidation Scenarios
Surge introduces micro-liquidation, a gradual, rule-based process that avoids full-position wipeouts. 
Liquidation occurs through stability pools, and may be triggered by:

- Extreme BTC price volatility breaching collateral thresholds
- Failure to maintain minimum repayment and health score
- Complete loan default, in which case the dVault is absorbed by the protocol as bad debt

This approach ensures fairness, minimizes losses, and aligns incentives between lenders, borrowers, and network participants.

:::info[Deterministic Liquidation]
Every liquidation follows a deterministic PSBT template stored at vault creation. This ensures liquidation can only execute if pre-defined conditions are met.
