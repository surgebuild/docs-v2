# ✊ For Bitcoiners

## Your Bitcoin, Your Terms.
Access a Bitcoin-native Credit Line, without giving up full-custody.

Surge gives you a flexible line of credit against your Bitcoin. It’s built for everyday Bitcoiners who value sovereignty, transparency, and verifiable custody, not centralized black boxes.

Your BTC stays in a unique, programmable Taproot vault, secured by a decentralized signer network using threshold Schnorr signatures. 
It’s on-chain, auditable, and non-custodial, always.


## 🚀 How It Works
### 1. Sign Up Securely
Get started via mobile app on Android or iOS. Sign up with just an email + OTP. We create a secure, self-custodial wallet with built-in backup and 2FA for enhanced protection.

### 2. Request a Credit Line
Specify your initial credit line amount. 

Credit lines have:
- Fixed interest rates (8–10% annually)
- A 12-month term with flexible repayment
- No need to draw full amount upfront - you control usage

### 3. Fund Your for
- A unique Taproot address is generated per credit line
- You deposit BTC at 50% LTV (e.g., send 0.1 BTC for $3K USDC credit)
- After 3–6 confirmations, your credit line becomes active

### 4. Draw & Repay Flexibly
- Withdraw stablecoins (USDC, USDT) to any address
- Spend, send, or off-ramp to a bank account
- Repay any time to reclaim your BTC
- Add more BTC to reduce LTV or unlock more credit

### 5. Stay Verifiably in Control
Your BTC is never moved without:
- Your signature, and
- Signer network co-signing based on programmable vault logic

If the system fails or goes offline, your vault includes a time-locked refund path—returning your BTC to your wallet after expiration.

### 6. Liquidation, but Fair
Liquidation doesn’t mean losing it all. Surge uses micro-liquidation, a rules-based process that only liquidates a portion of your BTC if collateral health declines.
- Triggered only when on-chain oracles (like BTC/USD price) report sustained volatility
- Price feeds are transparent and open—you can verify exactly what data is being used
- Liquidation happens incrementally via pre-committed vault logic, not via centralized decision-makers

This means no surprise wipeouts, no discretionary calls—just fair, on-chain enforcement.

### 7. KYC (If Required)
If you’re from a restricted jurisdiction, basic KYC may apply to meet compliance needs. Otherwise, most users can access Surge without KYC.
