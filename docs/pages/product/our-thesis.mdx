# 🔭  Our Thesis

## What
Bitcoin-backed lending today is still stuck in the past. Platforms are built around custodians, hidden rehypothecation, off-chain agreements, and predatory liquidations. 
They were designed for institutions and early whales, not for everyday Bitcoiners who hold their keys, believe in transparency, and need reliable access to liquidity.

## So What
That means millions of Bitcoiners, especially those holding under 10 BTC are left out. They’re forced to trust black-box lenders, pay excessive fees, or sell their BTC in emergencies. 
Worse, the core values of Bitcoin self-custody, openness, and verifiability are lost in the very systems meant to support it.

## Now What
Surge is building something fundamentally different: a Bitcoin-native credit market that puts users in control. 
With dVaults (programmable Bitcoin vaults), market-driven terms, and a decentralized signer network, Bitcoiners can borrow stablecoins without giving up custody, trust, or transparency. 
It’s a credit system designed for Bitcoiners, not institutions. Built on-chain. Aligned with the ethos.
