# 🔭  Our Thesis

## The Market Is Broken by Design
The Bitcoin-backed lending market today is heavily centralized. It’s shaped by layers of intermediaries, off-chain agreements, predatory liquidation terms, and black-box custody models. 
These platforms were built for institutions and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), offering white-glove services with selective risk management, private channels, and opaque decision-making.

For the average Bitcoin ( the one holding under 10 BTC ), this market offers little. 
They're either priced out, underserved, or forced to accept high-risk tradeoffs just to access liquidity.


## Everyday Bitcoiners Are Locked Out
The result is a system that contradicts Bitcoin’s ethos. 
While Bitcoin empowers individual sovereignty, the lending market disempowers grassroots holders:

- **Limited access:** Few platforms cater to the needs or scale of everyday Bitcoiners.
- **No custody transparency:** Users can't verify where their BTC is or how it’s being used.
- **Predatory practices:** Liquidations are sudden, opaque, and biased toward protecting institutional lenders.
- **Centralized pricing:** Borrowing terms are dictated, not discovered.

This exclusion stunts adoption and pushes Bitcoiners toward risky or inefficient alternatives.

## Surge Is Rebuilding from First Principles
Surge is a purpose-built lending protocol grounded in the needs of grassroots Bitcoiners. 
We’ve reimagined the lending stack with trust-minimized, transparent, and programmable infrastructure:

- **Verifiable Custody:** Remains locked in Taproot vaults on Bitcoin never wrapped or bridged.. It sits in a programmable vault (dVault), governed by Taproot scripts and decentralized signers. Borrowers can verify their BTC is unrehypothecated and secure.
- **Collaborative Self-Custody:** The borrower becomes part of the vault policy, enabling shared control - no single party can move funds.
- **Market-Cleared Terms:** Interest rates and loan terms are set by supply and demand, not a central desk. Terms are designed to favor flexibility and openness.
- **Transparent Micro-Liquidation:** Rather than wipe out a loan position overnight, Surge introduces micro-liquidation - gradual, rules-based actions governed by smart contracts.
- **On-Chain Loan Management:** Origination, repayment, status tracking, and liquidation logic - all verifiable on-chain and enforced by code, not humans.

Surge is not a wrapper over legacy models. It’s the start of a new lending standard for Bitcoiners.
