# 🔭  Our Thesis & Vision

- **Stick to Bitcoin’s ethos:** Trust-minimized > trustful. On-chain > paper trails.  
- **Expand utility:** HODLing is noble, but lending and programmable money bring Bitcoin alive.  
- **Democratize access:** Stablecoins shouldn't be gated behind CeFi walls.  
- **Fix what’s broken:** The CeFi failures of the past cycles are lessons, not templates.  

Our long term vision is simple but bold,

> **To become the Bitcoin App** — _just like the CashApps or Venmos of today, but rooted in decentralization_.

We start with lending, but **dVaults unlock an entire world of financial primitives to come.**
