# 👷 Infra Providers  
Infra providers secure Bitcoin collateral and power Surge’s execution layer. They enable the trust-minimized operation of dVaults and maintain system integrity.

## Signers
- Manage dVault keys using **secure TSS protocols**.
- Enforce custom vault rules (repayment, liquidation, migration, escape hatch).
- Participate in liquidation triggers and recovery mechanisms.

## Validators
- Run Surge’s **EVM-compatible execution layer** (`reth` + `CometBFT`).
- Participate in block production, ensuring deterministic finality.
- Validate vault state transitions, liquidation events, and cross-chain execution.

## Bootstrapping the Network
- Surge launches with a **permissioned set of 50+ infra providers**.
- Gradual rollout towards **permissionless participation** via staking + reputation.
- Rewards distributed in **BTC and stablecoins**, aligning incentives across stakeholders.

## 🌐 Why Surge?


- **For Bitcoiners**: Access stablecoin liquidity **without rehypothecation** or wrapped BTC.
- **For Stablecoin Holders**: Earn yield through transparent, BTC-backed lending markets.
- **For Infra Providers**: Secure the first non-custodial, cross-chain Bitcoin lending protocol and earn rewards.


Surge bridges the gap between Bitcoin’s security and stablecoin utility, creating a new class of **sovereign Bitcoin capital markets**.
