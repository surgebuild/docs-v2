# 👷 Infra Providers  

## Decentralized Network Nodes
Infrastructure providers are the backbone of Surge’s decentralized architecture. 
They enable trust-minimized operations for custody and execution. 
There are two key roles:

- Signer Nodes (for dVault custody and Taproot logic enforcement)
- Execution Nodes (for Bitcoin-aware loan lifecycle management)

### 🔑 Signer Network

Surge establishes a distributed and decentralized custody framework using multi-party computation (MPC) and threshold signature schemes (TSS). 
The signer network's core responsibilities include:

- Running lightweight clients that co-sign Bitcoin transactions alongside users for dVaults
- Executing Taproot-based scripts according to predetermined loan logic and conditions

Initially, the network will operate as a permissioned set of up to 20 signers, with capacity to scale to 50 nodes. 
Participation requires:

- Running minimal-cost infrastructure
- Staking BTC to ensure economic alignment

Eventually, this network will evolve into a fully permissionless signer set, expanding decentralization and resilience.

### ⚙️ Bitcoin-Aware Execution Layer

This layer manages loan terms, liquidity records, and contract logic in a decentralized, programmable environment.

- It’s built on a reth EVM client, integrated with CometBFT consensus for decentralized coordination.
- The system is Bitcoin-aware, enabling native, seamless communication between smart contracts and Bitcoin vaults.
- By eliminating reliance on third-party oracles, it enhances transparency and trust-minimization.

Surge aims for up to 100 validator nodes in this layer, launching with 20 in the early network phase—some of which may overlap with signer nodes.


### 💸 Incentives for Participation
Infra providers earn:

- BTC fees from transaction facilitation
- Basis points from loan interest/liquidity flows

As network usage grows, demand-driven incentives will rise, creating a robust, sustainable marketplace for infra operators.
