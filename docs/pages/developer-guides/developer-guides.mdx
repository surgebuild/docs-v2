# Developer Guides

Welcome to the Surge Network Developer Guides. Here you'll find comprehensive resources to help you build and innovate on the Surge Network.

## Supported Proof Systems

Surge is designed to accommodate following proving systems:

- ✅ [Groth16 by Jens Groth](https://www.zeroknowledgeblog.com/index.php/groth16)
- ✅ [Plonk with BN254](https://github.com/dusk-network/plonk)
- ✅ [SP1 by Succinct Labs](https://docs.succinct.xyz/)
- ✅ [The RISC Zero zkVM](https://dev.risczero.com/api/)

This foundational support enables developers to integrate these systems and fully utilize Surge's capabilities without any extra setup.

We plan to support all major proving systems in the future.
