# Verify Proofs

## Prerequisites

For SDK initialization steps, please refer to the [Submit Proofs](/developer-guides/surge-sdk/submit-proof#initialize-surge-bitcoin-zkp-sdk) guide first.

## Verify Proof parameters

```typescript
{
  "hash": "string" // tx hash from the submit proof of Surge Network
}
```

## Verify Proof

```typescript
const result = await client.verifyBitcoinSubmission(
  "surge_network_tx_hash" // hash of the submit proof tx for Surge Network
);
```

### Success Response

```typescript
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Transaction verified successfully",
    "error": null,
    "details": null,
    "bitcoin_tx_hash": "dc672330752289889b99836cfb235b20945b8022521d70eeb1b4823a92f305eb"
}
```

The `bitcoin_tx_hash` in the response represents the transaction hash of your proof that has been settled on the Bitcoin network. This serves as proof of settlement and can be viewed on the Surge Bitcoin Signet Explorer:
