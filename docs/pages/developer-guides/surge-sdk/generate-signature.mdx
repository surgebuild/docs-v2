# Generate Signatures

## Coming Soon!

Surge Network will soon introduce Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) based on the DKLs23 protocol for generating Schnorr signatures. This upcoming functionality will enable:

- Secure generation of Schnorr signatures through distributed key generation
- Threshold-based signature creation using DKLS23 protocol
- ECDSA compatibility for broad blockchain integration
- Enhanced security through distributed signing process
- No single point of failure in the signature generation

Stay tuned for updates on this exciting feature that will bring robust cryptographic capabilities to the Surge Network!
