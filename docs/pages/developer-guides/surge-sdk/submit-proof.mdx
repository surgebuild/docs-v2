# Submit Proofs to Bitcoin

## Prerequisites

To submit proofs to Bitcoin, you need a Surge wallet with sufficient balance. If you don't have one:

1. [Create a Surge wallet using Keplr](/developer-guides/wallets-tokens/connect-keplr)
2. [Get test tokens from the faucet](/developer-guides/wallets-tokens/get-tokens)

### Intialize Surge Bitcoin ZKP SDK

Package link [@surgebuild/bitcoin-zkp-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@surgebuild/bitcoin-zkp-sdk)

```bash
npm install @surgebuild/bitcoin-zkp-sdk
```

After installing the Surge SDK, you can initialize it with the following code:

```typescript
import { SurgeClient } from "@surgebuild/bitcoin-zkp-sdk";

const client = new SurgeClient();

await client.init(
  "your_private_key" //add your private key from your Wallet
);
```

### Submit proof to Surge netwrok with the parameters

```typescript
{
  "creator": "string", // owner public address
  "methodId": "string", // method.bin file path
  "proof": "string", // proof file path
  "proofSystem": "string", // proof system type "RISCZERO" or "SP1"
  "publicInputData": "string" // public input data file path for RISCZERO or empty string for SP1
}
```

### Note:

The file path provided in the parameters should be accessible by the node process.

### Submit Proofs

e.g proof submission,

```typescript
const res = await client.submitProof(
  "srg15428vq2uzwhm3taey9sr9x5vm6tk78ewcemlpx",
  "./method.bin",
  "./state_verifier.proof",
  "RISCZERO", //proof system type "RISCZERO" or "SP1"
  "./receipt.pub"
);
```

### Success Response

```typescript
{
  code: 0, // 0 for success
  transactionHash: "4FFBC70B5E4B9E112E4113CF54BD8F9058213229957FE7327BAFB46B39FCD028",
  txIndex: 0,
};
```

The `transactionHash` in the response represents the transaction hash on the Surge Network, which indicates soft finality of your proof submission. You can track your transaction's status on the Surge Explorer:

```
https://explorer-alphatestnet.surge.dev/txs/<transactionHash>
```

### Note:

Proof file will differ based on the proof system you are using. For RISCZERO, you need to pass the `receipt.pub` file as a public input data, whereas for SP1, you can pass the public input data as an empty string.
